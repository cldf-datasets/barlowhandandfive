colex,Is there colexification?,,
dist,Is distinctness due to lexical replacement or phonological change?,"For those languages that lack colexification, i.e. languages with value “lexically distinct” for parameter “Is there colexification?”, values for this parameter are “lexical replacement” or “phonological change”. However, some languages exhibit both lexical replacement and (partial) colexification; this is possible when there has been replacement of both ‘hand’ and ‘five’ such that the new forms are (partially) colexified: these cases are indicated by rows in ValueTable with an empty value and a comment “(recolexification)”.",
repl_hand,Was there lexical replacement of ‘hand’?,,
repl_five,Was there lexical replacement of ‘five’?,,
hand_replacement,What replaced ‘hand’?,"Values for this parameter are descriptions of the most likely etymology (traced as far back as possible in the Austronesian family) given for the word in the language that came to mean ‘hand’; values followed by “?” are somewhat uncertain; and those followed by “??” are even more uncertain; when no likely etymology has been posited, then the value is given simply as “unclear” (with no preceding etymology). Values are batched into five different categories, referenced by the `Code_ID` column.",
five_replacement,What replaced ‘five’?,"The same conventions apply here as for the parameter “What replaced hand?” except that here most entries are given a language-internal etymology. Values are batched into seven different categories, referenced by the `Code_ID` column.",
num_syst,What is the numeral system?,"The values for this parameter are taken from Barlow 2023, ""Papuan-Austronesian contact and the spread of numeral systems in Melanesia"".",
