five,What is the word for ‘five’?,,
hand,What is the word for ‘hand’?,,
colex,Is there colexification?,,
dist,Is distinctness due to lexical replacement or phonological change?,"For those languages that lack colexification (i.e., languages with value “lexically distinct” for the parameter “Is there colexification?”), the values for this parameter are “lexical replacement” or “phonological change”. However, some languages exhibit both lexical replacement and (partial) colexification; this is possible when there has been replacement of both ‘hand’ and ‘five’ such that the new forms are (partially) colexified: these cases are indicated by rows in the ValueTable with an empty value and a comment “(recolexification)”.",
repl_hand,Was there lexical replacement of ‘hand’?,,
repl_five,Was there lexical replacement of ‘five’?,,
hand_replacement,What replaced ‘hand’?,"Values for this parameter are descriptions of the most likely etymology (traced as far back as possible in the Austronesian family) given for the word in the language that came to mean ‘hand’; values followed by “?” are somewhat uncertain; and those followed by “??” are even more uncertain; when no likely etymology has been posited, then the value is given simply as “unclear” (with no preceding etymology). Values are batched into five different categories, referenced by the `Code_ID` column.",
five_replacement,What replaced ‘five’?,"The same conventions apply here as for the parameter “What replaced hand?” except that here most entries are given a language-internal etymology. Values are batched into seven different categories, referenced by the `Code_ID` column.",
num_syst,What is the numeral system?,"The values for this parameter  are taken from Barlow (2023) “Papuan-Austronesian contact and the spread of numeral systems in Melanesia”, updated here to reflect changes between Glottolog 4.6 and Glottolog 5.0: (1) badu1237 is removed (subsumed within sund1252); (2) bali1287 is added (with numeral system “unknown”); (3) dalk1234 is added (with numeral system “unknown”); (4) mori1267 is added (split from maor1246: both with numeral system “decimal proper”); and (5) ngga1239 is added (with numeral system “unknown”).",
