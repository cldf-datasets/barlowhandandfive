Adzera, Papua New Guinea	adze1240-1	adze1240	adze1240	five	bɑŋin mɑɾɑfɑiʔ	( litː one hand )		chan2019	Adzera.htm		Mr. David Howard, SIL International, Papua New Guinea, May 20, 2011.	According to Sue Holzknecht's old data recorded 20 years ago. Adzera people might have an old counting system combines a counting system based on two with tallying on hand and feet up to 20. However, now Adzera really has only two basic numbers: one and two. Everything else is either a combination of those two numbers or some anatomical extension like one hand, two hands, etc. But Adzera never, to my knowledge, had a full counting system as some PNG languages do where they count different points on the body. I don't know what other Austronesian counting systems are like. Having only two and one and then having to use a hand for five makes for a very inefficient counting system, and traditionally they probably didn't have to do a lot of precision counting and math in their culture. So what has happened is Tok Pisin and English counting systems have largely replaced the Adzera counting system. When talking about only a few items, they will often use the Adzera numerals, but they sometimes use the Tok Pisin and English numbers even for small numbers and, in my experience, they always use Tok Pisin or English numerals for larger numbers (probably anything larger than five). Because those and many of the numbers Holzknecht gave would most likely be substituted with English and Tok Pisin numbers. You would be much more likely to hear 'five' or 'faivpela' or see '5' or '5-pela' written than to hear or see 'iruʔ da iruʔ da bitsʔ (two and two and one) or 'baŋin bitsintaʔ' (one hand) or 'baŋi marafain' (hand one-side). Sue uses a <c> to represent the alveo-palatal affricate, which is represented by <ts> in Adzera and usually <ch> in English. This is often pronounced closer to [ts] in English. For 'one' I often hear [bisinta'], rather than [bitsinta'], but generally continue to spell it with a <ts> rather than just <s>. This may be dialect variation. The short form is [bits], with the <ts> consistently more alveolar than alveo-palatal, i.e. more like <ts> in English than <ch>. The short form often has the connotation of 'one more'. Sue uses a superscript <n> to represent prenasalisation in the phonetic transcription, which appears simply as an <n> in the Adzera orthography. I have changed <ng> to eng in some places and corrected a couple glosses. Glottal stops are represented with apostrophes in the Adzera orthography. I have not seen the form [iruʔun] or <iru'un>. The form I am familiar with is [iruʔrun] or <iru'run>. I have even seen a longer form, [iruʔruŋun] or <iru'ruŋun>. I'm not sure if Sue's transcription is a mistake or a dialectual variant. As Sue transcribed, the short form for 'two' is [iruʔ] or <iru'>, and it can mean not only 'two', but also 'a few'. The long form always refers specifically to 'two'.

Aklanon (Inakeanon) is spoken in northern Panay Island, Philippines, The Austronesian and Spanish system seem to co-exist well in Aklanon. They tend to count up to ten, and use hundreds and thousands with the Austronesian (inherited) system. But Spanish has encroached as an option for events such as the hours of the day which never use the native system. '1, one' isaɣáh [strictly in counting] < PAN *isá + PSP *da [discourse particle 'only'], otherwise in enumerating an archaic frozen classifier system is used: sambáto [one inanimate], sambílog [one animate], sambúʔo [one cylindrical object with liquid inside: egg, coconut, can] 400 ápʔat ka gatós | kwatro syéntos 800 waɣóŋ gatós | otso syéntos Note on accent. An open accented penult vowel is long and high. Technically the colon I've used above is redundant, but for phonetic purposes more accurate for anyone who would not know the rules of Central Philippine accentual system.

Tokyo: Sanseido Press.	The above data are taken from Northern dialect of Amis. Amis has a typical decimal system found in most Western Austronesian languages. The data are converted to IPA symbols based on the speakers’ transcription/orthography. Notice that in Amis, the glottal stop before and after vowels are optionally transcribed, and vowels /u/ and /o/ are used as free variations and the the symbol [ʡ] is an epiglottal plosive. (1) According to Tsuchida (1988), there are five major dialects in Amis: Sakizaya (or Sakiraya), Northern (or Nanshi Amis), Tavalong-Vataan, Central, (Haian Amis and Hsiukulan Amis excluding Tavalong-Vataan) and Southern (Peinan Amis and Hengchun Amis). Sakizaya has been politically recognized as an independent language by the government of Taiwan, and hence, its data will not be listed in the table. Notice that Tsuchida’s classification is slightly different from the dialects officially recognized by the Taiwanese government, which are Northern, Central (including Tavalong-Vataan Amis and Hsiukulan Amis in Tsuchida’ classification), Haian, Malan (or Falangaw, roughly corresponding to Peinan Amis in Tsuchida’s classification), and Hengchun. The examples from Vataan are collected from Hui- Mei Lin, a native speaker of this dialect. The rest of the examples are cited from the 1000-word Vocabulary List published by the Council of Indigenous Peoples: 1229CD7C. However, I have made some corrections after double checking with the native speakers. The List published on-line still needs further proof-reading and revision. (2) Puluʡ/puloʡ/poloʡ or is used as “10” in serial counting, while mukətəp/muɁtəp /moɁətəp mukətəp/muɁtəp/moɁətəp moətəp also means “10” but is used in a non- serial counting contexts (i.e. as a modifier or a predicate). The speaker of Vataan only provides me muɁtəp here. I am not sure if it can be used in serial counting in this dialect. (3) Sabaw or safaw roughly means the “the decimal digit”. tu is the oblique case (4) ''a'' in 20 and other tens is a a linker. It shows up between a modifier and a noun. (5) “maləbut” or “ləfot” originally means “angry”. It is used metaphorically here as when one has to count up to 1000, one might get impatient and angry.

"Austral or Rurutu has a traditional vigesimal system, but now people change to use Tahitian numeral system now. This is due to the language contact as well as recent tendency that the young generations dare not speak Rurutu and tend to choose French, the first syllable of glottal stop is sometimes dropped. However, if I speak with the aged people over 50, they always pronounce glottal stop. I am working only Rurutu island, with a population of 2000), in your old data, probably the researcher include every 5 island in Austral such as Tubuai, Raivave, etc, that is why it is written 8000. As my understanding, although mutual communication is possible between Austral islanders, the each island speak each local language, because at school, in Tubuai island, they don't say or learn ""Rurutu"" language, but ""Tubuai language""."

January 21, 2019.	Ahamb or Axamb is an endangered language spoken on a small island off the southern coast of Malekula in Vanuatu. This language has a traditional quinary counting system before and the number for 20 actually could possibly be broken down into nren 'man' and havui, which is unclear, but could be related to vui 'good. However, all Ahamb speakers know well and use daily the numerals 1-5. Most speakers know the numerals 6-20 but they are rarely used. Numerals above 20 are only remembered by a few elderly speakers. Note that the symbols [ë] is a schwa = IPA [ə], and [ü] corresponds to IPA [y].

There are terms which are differently suffixed again and were formerly used for e.g. elongated things, leaves etc. (comparable to numeral classifiers), but to present speakers only the numbers one - three are generally known and these paradigms seem to have become obsolete.

Biak, Papua, Indonesia	biak1248-1	biak1248	biak1248	five	rim			chan2019	Biak.htm		Dr. Wilco van den Heuvel, Linguistic researcher, Free University of Amsterdam (Vrijie Universiteit Amsterdam), Amsterdam, Netherlands. January 13, 2005, June 15, 2012.	Biak has a decimal system, this language is predominantly spoken on the islands Biak, Eastern Indonesia. To combine the tens with the simple units of 1 till ten, one uses the word sesr or sesr di. The word sesr can be analyzed as a noun, related to the word eser 'one', and be translated as 'unit'. The word di, on the other hands, is an allophone of the ri that links numerals with the noun that they modify, as we will see and the analysis explains why the word for 'eleven' is samfur sesr eser, without the linker ri, whereas the word for 'twelve' is samfur sesr ri suru. The numeral linker ri is not used to link a noun with the number eser, but only for the linking of a noun with one of the numbers two till nine. The words for 'eleven', twelve', 'twenty four' and 'nine hundred eleven' then can be analyzed as followsː 11. samfur sesr oser ː 'ten (and) one unit ' 12. samfur sesr di suru ː 'ten (and) NUM.LNK two unit ' 911. utin di siw samfur sesr oser ː 'hundred NUM.LNK nine ten unit one ', 'nine hundreds ten (and) one unit ' > nine hundred eleven. 10.0000. syaran samfur 1.000.000. juta (loanword from Indonesian) We can see in attributive position the cardinal numbers up to and including nine - except eser / oser 'one' - are linked to the preceding noun by the numeral linker ri. The numeral eser / oser 'one' can be modify the noun by simple juxtaposition, while the numerals samfur 'ten' can be linked by simple juxtaposition or by the numerals linker ri. Numbers higher than ten can only be linked with the preceding noun by juxtaposition.

December 7, 2010, December 6, 2012, April 25, 2014.	"Papitalai has a typical ""Manus type"" Austronesian language decimal counting system with special structure for numerals 6 to 9. It seems the number 6 is a loanword from Polynesian language. I have realized on my last field trip that Papitalai is not a separate language from Koro, but is rather just a dialect of Koro. I'm not aware of any differences in the numeral systems of different Koro dialects, but there may be some that I don't know about. For now you could list the data I gave you for Papitalai as being Koro (Papitalai dialect). Note that the numbers 90 and 1000 are taken from Dr. Glennon A. Lean's old data in orthographic spelling twenty years ago. Note: The forms that are listed there for numerals 1-9 always occur with a numeral classifier suffix. This means that the forms listed are never actually spoken. There are several numeral classifiers, including general classifier -h, person classifier -mou, tree classifier -ei, basket classifier -hat, etc. I would suggest you either list the numbers 1-9 with the general classifier, or put a hyphen on the end to indicate that they obligatorily take a numeral classifier suffix. The numbers with the general classifier are as follows: 1 tih 2 moruwah 3 matalah 4 mahahu 5 malimah 6 mawonoh 7 mandotalah 8 mandoruwah 9 mandotih"

Ndenggan (Banam Bay), Vanuatu	burm1263-1	burm1263	burm1263	five	erim			chan2019	Ndenggan-BanamBay.htm		Miss Brittany Hoback, PhD candidate at Victoria University of Wellington, Linguistics and Applied Linguistics Department, New Zealand. February 5, 2019.	Ndenggan or Banam Bay is an endangered language spoken on southeast coast of Malekula in Vanuatu. This language has a traditional quinary counting system before, currently up to ten is used in language, but beyond does typically borrow from Bislama, though there is interest in putting past ten into the primary school curriculum, so it could be that the younger generations will use Ndenggan numerals for all of their counting. Ndenggan means of the place, or if this place. It is the name that the community has decided upon instead of Banam Bay Language, since only a portion of the villages are actually adjacent to Banam Bay. The orthography is by design inclusive of the prenasalized consonants. The intent was to keep as much of the local sounds within the writing system as a way of language maintenance for the younger generations. We are still exploring how this effects literacy and ease of reading, but that is what the community desires for now.

For the numbers 1 and 2 there may be a difference in register since the aspirated t of 1 is from *sa and the one for 2 is from *dua. The same would be true for 8 and 9. Please change the number three to tlau which I just discovered looks like an aspirated t rather than tl. The number 5 has the shift of nasalized a to the high central vowel like Cham, but it also adds a velar nasal after the vowel. The r that I wrote in the word for 100 may be a voiced velar fricative or possibly a non-syllabic high unrounded central vowel as in Northern Roglai. I may have written an r because of my N. Roglai influence although in that environment, N. Roglai has no consonant but only a lengthening of the vowel. I see that I wrote a voiced velar fricative in other words in Cat Gia words.

Central Sama, Philippines	cent2092-1	cent2092	cent2092	five	'lima			chan2019	Sama-Central.htm		Mr. Jeremiah James. SIL-Philippines, January 30 2012.	Central Sama has a decimal system similar to that of Northern Sama. Notesː (1) [ˈs̩ːa] is the form used in counting. In numbering items, however, the word [daˈkajuʔ] is used. It is a combination of the prefix da- 'one' and the root kajuʔ 'item,' which seems to be a frozen form as it appears now only in this word. (2) ə represents a high-central vowel which in multi-syllabic words shifts slightly in the direction of the vowel of the following syllable. It occurs only before long consonants or homorganic consonant clusters. When ə appears in world-initial position, it is typically elided, e.g. /ˈəs.sa/→[ˈs̩ːa]. (3) [aˈkadːa] is a combination of the clitic dda [ˈdːa], or the numeral [ˈs̩ːa], with the ordinary conjunction maka 'and.' In ordinary speech maka can be shortened to aka, or even ka, when used in numbers. (4) [ˈŋibu] appears to be a combination of a nasal linker or ligature (e.g. [damˈbulan] 'one month' from bulan 'month') with a root [ˈibu] 'thousand'. For example, ibu- ibuhan 'thousands and thousands; by the thousand.' (5) Two additional lexical items may be of interest: [ˈlaksaʔ] 'a unit of 10,000; by extension, any large, uncountable group'. [ˈlaksaʔ] combines as do the other roots: [daˈlaksaʔ, ˌduwaˈlaksaʔ], etc.

Central Dusun, Sabah, Malaysia	cent2100-1	cent2100	cent2100	five	limo			chan2019	Dusun-Central.htm		Prof. Shelly Harrison, University of Western Australia, Australia, June 23, 2014.	Central Dusun has a decimal system similar to that of Kimaragang. The data was supplied by Ms. Veronica Atin, who was a student at UWA for a period overlapping with my retirement. Some notes on these data: 1. The status of final glottal stops in Dusun languages is problematic. Some investigators (like Paul Kroeger, in his work on Kimaragang) believe them to be phonemic, but I am far from convinced that this is the case. When Ms. Atin first gave me data on the numerals, she did so in written form. She had final glottal stops–which she rendered as apostrophe–in exactly those numerals in which they appear in the Kadazan-Dusun dictionary (as reflected in your Coastal Kadazan data). Ms Atin did tend to be influenced by that dictionary when she was uncertain. In general, she was inconsistent in transcribing final glottal stops, as I was in hearing them. A UWA honours student, whose honours dissertation used Dusun data from a field methods class held after I'd retired, had a similar problem to mine with glottal stop, and didn't use it in her renderings of Central Dusun numerals. Even Paul Kroeger, who regards glottal stop as phonemic in the related Dusun language Kimaragang, talks about it as optional in some environments. So suit yourself regarding whether to put it in or leave it out in the above data. 2. The form soribu 'one thousand' is a bit of a problem. It is a reflex of PMP *Ribu 'thousand', and could be a native Dusun form. It could also be a borrowing from Malay seribu. (Malay borrowing are common in Dusun languages, since Malay is replacing Dusun in many functions. Given the close genetic relationship between Malay and Dusun languages, borrowings are not always obvious.) There is another Central Dusun root rioŋ 'thousand' that popped up once in my data, but doesn't seem to be the usual form for 'thousand'. The prefix so- 'one' is also etymologically ambiguous: maybe Dusun and maybe Malay. It alternates with a prefix soŋ- 'one', which is the more frequent in my data. Both are occasionally found with the same root e.g. soikar ~ songikar 'an acre'.

The above data is from Wasambua dialect of Cia-Cia language spoken in Buton Island, Sulawesi, Indonesia. Wasambua is a dialect of Cia-Cia [ISO-639-3 cia]. Wasambua is spoken by the older members of about eighty households in the neighborhood (kelingkungan) of the same name in the village of Lakambau in the southwestern quadrant of Buton Island, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia (5° 36.28' S 122° 35.78' E). It is unclear from the recording whether ompulu ‘ten’ is preceded by a glottal stop or not.

Muslim, and La Ode Asmin and transcribed by Dr. David Mead.	The above data is from Masiri dialect of Cia-Cia language spoken in Buton Island, Sulawesi, Indonesia. Note that the form satu ‘one,’ borrowed from Indonesian, is used as the initial numeral in straight counting. The form ameʔea is used in counting one of something, and in higher numeral combinations (eleven, twenty-one, etc.).

Kaisabu is a divergent dialect of Cia-Cia, and it should be probably considered a separated language. Note the vowel coalescence that occurs with xoa + anu → xoanu ‘two’ and siua + anu → siuanu ‘nine’, but does not occur with lima + anu ‘five’. The forms given above are used for straight counting. anu can be omitted when reaching twenty, thirty, etc. thus xoapulu (rather than xoapuluanu), tolupulu (rather than tolupuluanu), etc. Anu is omitted when counting money, e.g. limaxivu ‘five thousand (rupiah)’, limapulu ‘fifty (thousand rupiah)’. When counting items, kaalu [ˈkaːlu] ~ [kaˈalu] is used instead of anu. These forms run: akaalu, xoakaalu, tolukaalu, patokaalu, limakaalu, nomokaalu, pitukaalu, alukaalu, siuakaalu, ompulukaalu, etc. When counting days, the base also is used, with intercalated glottal stop. These forms run: aʔalo ‘one day’, xoaʔalo ‘two days’, toluʔalo ‘three days’, patoʔalo ‘four days’, limaʔalo ‘five days’, nomoʔalo ‘six days’, pituʔalo ‘seven days’, aluʔalo ‘eight days’, siuaʔalo ‘nine days’, ompuluʔalo ‘ten days’, etc.

Referenceː Francesca Romana Moro, A Sketch grammar of Dampelas, a language of central Sulawesi, February 3, 2010, Leiden University, the Netherlands.	Dampelas has a decimal numeral system. Notes: Pipitu is articulated [pɪpitu] in the first recording, and [pipitu] in the second (003B_100809_0530.) but while eliciting the numerals also the form [pepitu] emerged. There seems to be quite a lot of variation intra speaker and inter speakers. Sesio is articulated [sesio] in the first recording, but in the second recording the form [sɪsio] was produced. Bapak Yamin (10 August 2010) pronounces nine as sesio in one recording, and sisio (with the first i more centralized [sɪsio]). There seems to be variation between [e] and [ɪ] in the first syllable. Note that the informants have volunteered the minimal pair sesio ‘nine’ and sisio [sisio] ‘mosquito’. Hapata ['hapatA] is pronounced with a paragogic vowel a during the recordings but when elicit the form hapat was provided. I need to investigate how the numerals are used in NPs. It seems that pepitu is used for object and pitu for time expressions (?) Berapa kali tembak? Pitu miti ‘seven times’ ( 7 kali) *Pepitu miti Berapa telur kamu beli di pasar? Pepitu intol ‘seven eggs’ (7 telur) *pitu intol Berapa saudara kamu punya? Pepitu *pitu

Dusner has a five-base (quinternary) number system. The numerals up to thirty and the word meaning 'one hundred' are as above. The numeral snontu 'twenty' also means 'person'. The meaning for rimbi 'five' apparently related to 'hand. We are not able to elicit many of the higher numbers, the speakers are more used to using Indonesian or Wandamen rather that Dusner in counting, but the forms for the numerals forty, fifty, etc exist and were formerly in use. Note that the speaker produced the form snontu tori for the numerals 60, but this is the form that speaker used for the numeral 23.

Dusun Malang is a Barito language, classified under Austronesian, Malayo-Polynesian, Greater Barito, East, Central-South, South (Lewis, Simons, Fennig 2015). The total population is 4,500 people (Lewis, Simons, Fennig 2015). It is spoken in the Central Kalimantan Province, North Barito regency, Indonesia. Villages that speak DM (Dunsun Malang), ordered from Muara Teweh, the capital of the regency, up northward or upstreamward of Barito river, are Teluk Mayang, Ipu, Lahei, Luwe, Nihan, Paparpunjung, Teluk Melawai, Benao (Benoa), Karamuan. A minor lexical difference exists between Ipu and Teluk Mayang with the rest of the villages, e.g. leweu’ (Ipu) vs. rabaru’ (Karamuan) ‘lake’, rarap (Ipu) vs. kepek (Karamuan) ‘fan’. DM has a lexical similarity of 90% with Dusun Bayan (Lewis, Simons, Fennig 2015; henceforth called DB). Both variants are mutually intelligible, with some minor lexical differences that can be understood contextually by the speakers. Dusun Malang has a decimal system similar to that of Ma'anyan language. There are some differences for numbers 1, 2 and 9 in Dusun Bayan. Other higher numbersː 10,000ː puluʔ ribu (DBː sepuluʔ ribu), 1000,000ː eray peloŋ, (DBː eray jutaʔ) Note that the traditional symbol 'j' used in Indonesian linguistics has been written as IPA symbol [d͡ʒ'] here, the [e] is a mid front.

Enggano Sumatra, Indonesia	engg1245-1	engg1245	engg1245	five	ʔarib			chan2019	Enggano.htm		Mr. Brendon Yoder. SIL International, June 9, 2010. February 19, 2011.	Enggano has a numeral system very different from other Western Austronesian languages and now is regards as an 'Unclassified language' within the Austronesian Phylum but on 18th edition of 'Ethnologue' 2015, Enggano has been re-classified as 'Unclassified language', not conclusively established as an Austronesian language. Enggano has not been fully studied for several decades. A few sociolinguistic notes. Enggano is now spoken by about 700 people, all of whom are also fluent in Indonesian. But Enggano is still the language of the home for most. The numeral system, however, is rarely used since people have switched almost entirely to the more straightforward Indonesian numeral system, even when speaking Enggano. My language informants (both men and women, ages 30-40) were able to remember the Enggano forms 1-10 with ease, and with a bit of discussion found all of the forms through 20. But it took them a few days to discuss with older villagers and agree on the higher numeral forms (20-2000). I also questioned a group of 10-12 year old boys about numbers – they could only remember one, two, and three. Other notesː i. In diphthongs ending in a high vowel /i/ or /u/ before a glottal stop, the high vowel laxes to [ɪ] or [ʊ], respectively. So this kahaiʔ is pronounced kahaɪʔ in isolation. See also number 10. ii Literally, ‘five and two’. Phonetically the conjunction can either be he or hi; these two forms seem to be in free variation. iii Literally, ‘hugging’. Note that there are two inflected forms of this word which seem to be used interchangeably: kĩ-pa?ĩõp and ã-pãʔĩõp. The root is pã?ĩõp, which can exist independently as well as the imperative form of the verb ‘hug’. This might be a reference to the shape of the number 8, which could be seen as two objects hugging. This is my speculation and has not been confirmed by Enggano speakers. iv ka-ba kahai? literally, ‘one coming.’ This seems to mean ‘eight, and one more’. The full form seems to be kĩ?pã?ĩõp ka-ba kahai?. Perhaps the word for eight is not explicit here since it was just mentioned in sequence during the elicitation. See numbers 19 and 29, where the full form is attested. v kĩ?pã?ãũ? looks like another verb, since ki- and pa- are both prefixes and can occur in this order; as in the form ki-pa-pe ‘give’. I missed this connection while I was on the field, so I don’t know what the verb root (ãũ? ???) means. Phonetically, this word also undergoes high vowel laxing in a glide before a glottal stop. So phonetically the word is kĩ?pã?ãũ?. vi ratuh ‘hundred’ is borrowed from Malay ratus ‘hundred’, so kahai? ratuh is presumably the more recent form. dibu ‘thousand’ is borrowed from Malay ribu ‘thousand’. vii kĩ?pã?ãũ? he ãpã?ĩõp abai kaha? ‘ten and eight one coming’. Note that there are different inflections of the verbs on the various forms of 8 and 9, with the prefixes ki- and a- and the suffix –i. During this trip I did not have the opportunity to do research into Enggano morphology, so I do not know the significance of these different forms. I present them here as given to me during elicitation. viii kahai? kak literally ‘one person’. My informants told me that this is because a person has twenty digits – ten fingers and ten toes. Phonetically, the last part of the glide and the glottal stop metathesize, yielding the surface form kaha?ɪ kak. This is true for all the 20’s, 100, and 1000. Enggano Consonantsː Bilabial Alveolar Palatal Velar Glottal Plosive p, b t, d k ʔ Fricative s * x * h Nasal m n Tril r Approximant j w Lateral approximant l * 1 Occurs only word-finally in a few native words. [s] and [x] may be allophones. 2 Occurs only word-finally in a few native words. Phonetically a velar fricative [x] after non-front vowels [ɨ], [ə] and [u]; a palatal fricative after front vowels [a], [ã] and [i]. 3 Occurs in only a few native words. Enggano Vowels:

Ga'dang, the Philippines	gadd1244-1	gadd1244	gadd1244	five	lima			chan2019	Gadang.htm		Ms. Kathleen Forfia (Kippy Forfia), SIL International, Philippines, with Ms. Agripinna Eguid, the Ga'dang native speaker, June 24, 1993, December 4, 2013. Dr. Michael Walrod, President, Canada Institute of Linguistics at Trinity Western University, Canada, February 17, 2011.	Ga'dang has a decimal system. There are two sets of compound numerals 11 to 19, 21 to 29. The first is the older one used only by old people and the second set use both by old and young generations. The above data is phonemic, based on 1993's record by Kathleen Forfia, with the help of native speaker Agripinna Eguid. The “f” in the Ga'dang orthography is a voiceless bilabial fricative, not a labiodental fricative. Glottal stops occur before vowel initial words, but are not written in the orthography, and are written with one “'” when they are geminate. There is contrast between the open central “a” and the mid central “ə” only post-stress, with them both becoming “ə” pre-stress, and the contrast not being written in the orthography.

September 19, 2012.	Dadu'a has a decimal system of counting similar to that of Galoli language, but different from the Tugun language in nearby Wetar Island. Dadu'a has around 1200 speakers. It is spoken on the north coast of mainland Timor Leste, in the Ilimano area of Manatuto district. This is about 40km east of the Timorese capital, Dili. The speakers of Dadu'a are a group whose ancestors resettled from the island of Ataúro, to the north. The closest relatives to Dadu'a are the 3 varieties of Ataúro which I sent you data for. Based on a 100-word Swadesh list, the lexical cognacy among these four varieties ranges from 65-75%. These are all related to the varieties of Wetar and the much larger Galoli language of mainland Timor. Complicating things, Dadu'a is under intense contact influence from Galoli, while it looks like the speakers of Talur on Wetar island are a recently displaced group of Galoli speakers (±90% lexical cognacy).

the Bwatoo lexical items in french and provides more semantic features. Along
with the translation in french, this dictionary provide a translation for
Haeke and Haveke as well. The second one translates the french lexical items

information on the semantic features. The second dictionary has been used
first to find the targeted word in Bwatoo, and then, from the Bwatoo word, the
first dictionary has been used to find the translation in Haeke and Haveke.
When there is more than one term found in Bwatoo for one lexical entry in
french, the first dictionary and the developed semantic features it provides
has been used to reduce as much as possible the variation and to keep the more
relevant term"

Hahon, Papua New Guinea	haho1237-1	haho1237	haho1237	five	'taunima			chan2019	Hahon.htm		Mr. Stephen Logan, PhD Candidate, Department of Linguistics, ELDTA Research Group, School of Humanities & Social Science, University of New Castle, Callaghan, Newcastle, Australia. April 17, 2013. Referenceː G. A. Lean, 1990-1992, Counting Systems of Papua New Guinea, The Papua New Guinea University of Papua New Guinea of Technology, Papua New Guinea.	Hahon has a quinary system. The basic Hahon data I recorded is the same as the data you sent me from G.A. Lean's book, except that I did not find [amba] for 'two' nor did I find [sabun] for 'ten'. [a'mbua] does occur before nouns which occur with the article /a/ in the singular e.g. /a bua ti/ 'the two men', since voiced stops are prenasalised after a vowel. I should also have pointed out that the /a/ here is an article. There is a noun class system in Hahon, and the basic diagnostic for class membership is to determine which of the articles /a/ /e/ or /o/ the singular noun can occur with. When the numbers ‘two’ and ‘three’ are used to modify nouns, we find that they have different forms depending on the class of the noun which they are modifying, as follows: /a ti/ ‘person (singular)’ /a bua ti/ ‘two people’ /o atova/ ‘sago tree (singular)’ /o boko atova/ ‘two sago trees’ /a vamioko/ ‘pawpaw fruit (singular)’ /kuka vamioko/ ‘three pawpaws’ /o vamioko/ ‘pawpaw tree (singular)’ /kukano vamioko/ ‘three pawpaw trees’ These variants also occur in the periphrastic numbers above five, but examples are not frequent: /o tsinivi/ ‘canoe (singular)’ /o taunima mono kukano tsinivi/ ‘eight canoes’ Note also that the conjunction here changes from /mana/ to /mono/. In the Matetsora dialect this also occurs with the number ‘one’, but is possibly being lost /o tsinivi/ ‘canoe (singular)’ /payo tsinivi/ ‘one canoe’ Although most people know the traditional counting system, the Tok Pisin numbers are becoming more common for the numbers above five. Numbers and Noun Classes in Hahon When counting the numbers are as in the list except for the following differences in stress assignment: ‘three’ /'kukana/ ‘thirty /'kuka 'savun/ ‘fifty’ /'taunima 'savun/

- Maurice LEENHARDT's questionnaire reworked by André-Georges HAUDRICOURT; this questionnaire has been used in the village of Oundjo (1959) and Népou (1963)

The book of RIVIERRE & al. Contains two dictionaries. The first one translates
the Bwatoo lexical items in french and provides more semantic features. Along
with the translation in french, this dictionary provide a translation for
Haeke and Haveke as well. The second one translates the french lexical items

information on the semantic features. The second dictionary has been used
first to find the targeted word in Bwatoo, and then, from the Bwatoo word, the
first dictionary has been used to find the translation in Haeke and Haveke.

Hovongan, Kalimantan, Indonesia	hovo1239-1	hovo1239	hovo1239	five	dīmo			chan2019	Hovongan.htm		Mr. & Mrs. David & Teresa Searcy, NTM, Kalimantan. January 21, 1995. March 6, 2012.	"Hobangan or Hovongan is a small language with about 1,000 population (1991 NTM) spoken in West Kalimantan Province near Sarawak and East Kalimantan Province borders; Kapuas Hulu Regency, far northeast corner. Alternate names: Punan Bungan. Hobongan is situationed at the head of the Kapuas river in North eastern part of Kal-Bar, but actually a long ways from Sarawak and East Kal. The Hobongan has been spelled in the literature with a ""v"". This is not correct. After 35 years working with this language, I myself, my wife, my daughter and my son and his wife, and our 4 former partners are all agreed on this. We are all trained linguist.This is a ""b"" fricative in the particular environment of the word ""hobongan"". There are also hard ""b"" in other environments. Our daughter has done a linguistic write up on this and we could possibly get that to you. Generally word or utterance initial the b is a full stop, but in word or utterance medial the b changes to a fricative. The problem comes in our translation and literacy program. We have correctly written all hard and fricative voiced bi-labial's as a ""b"". The Indonesians without phonetic training are hearing a ""v"" so wrote it that way and it make it's way into the literature. The Hobongan themselves occasionally see it written as a ""v"" by what they consider educated people so and then cast doubt on what we have done. As I understand Penyabung was the name give by the Dutch, having to do with the attitude of the people (Bersabung - fighting cocks) Semukung is the name of the high caste within the Hobongan group. There are still people considered decedents of that caste. Uheng is the name of the Kapuas river in the Hobongan language. They always identify themselves by the name of the river they live on EX. Uheng Hobongan Hobo'ong Koreho Busang - Arino Hobongan - people of the Hobongan watershed. The single name means more than just the river it also takes in the idea of the water shed area. Notes. 1 = ci' (in counting but in text would be ""itup"" - EX. Kube koring na'a kom? Itup oh. How many bodies (fish pigs etc) did you (plural) get? answer Only one. One million rupiah would be stated at ""ci obot"" (one bundle) or ci juta, 1,000 = seribu - they could say ci' ribu but I never him don't hear them say it. 1,000,000 = ci juta (without the gottal stop) In the higher numbers it gets mixed up a lot with Indonesian."
Huaulu, Maluku, Indonesia	huau1237-1	huau1237	huau1237	five	lima			chan2019	Hualulu.htm		Mr. Bob S. Clark, NTM, Asia-Pacific, November 26, 2013.	Huaulu is an endangered language. Huaulu has a decimal system. The word for ‘10’ hutusa, is a contraction of hutu and esa, or ‘one (unit of) ten.’ There are no loan words, though the word for ‘5’ is the same as the national language and a great deal of other Austronesian languages. Any occurrence of hutu can alternately be pronounced futu, with no change in meaning. I don’t have a phonetic chart to send you, but the phonetics in this language are quite straightforward. The only relevant phonetic fact for this data is that the letter written ‘f’ is actually pronounced as a ‘p fricative.’ As may be obvious, the word ‘eha’ is equivalent to ‘plus’ in English.

This book presents a thematic lexicon and a phonological comparaison of four languages, based on several fieldworks made by André-Georges HAUDRICOURT (in 1959) and Françoise OZANNE-RIVIERRE (1973, 1976, 1978). 
The lexicon is translating french words into those four targeted languages. They are spoken on the north-west side of the Grande Terre island in New Caledonia. 
- If for an english word in the list, there are several lexical item including one single lexical unit, a compound (i.e made of several lexical units), or even a word resulting of a derivation, the word being a single lexical unit has been retained before anything else
- If more than one word in Jawe, has been found for a single english word, some specifications about the use of the different words not being morphological variables have been, when possible, provided in the 'Author annotation' column
- As the authors provide sometimes the lexical item form within and out of a possessive construction (note that there is two types of possession in this language : alienable and unalienable), we have decided to retain the corresponding forms provided for unalienable possession, althought the possessive personal pronoun itself has not been retained. Only the word with a dash (for instance 'cii-', 'his/her skin') has been entered along with the world out of possessive contructions, when showed by the authors
Some worlds have different forms depending on the geographical location. Those locations to which are related those different forms are put in parenthesis ('Y' is for the Yambe location, and 'W' for the Wevia location)"

- If for an english word in the list, there are several lexical item including one single lexical unit, a compound (i.e made of several lexical units), or even a word resulting of a derivation, the word being a single lexical unit has been retained before anything else
- If more than one word in Jawe, has been found for a single english word, some specifications about the use of the different words not being morphological variables have been, when possible, provided in the 'Author annotation' column
- As the authors provide sometimes the lexical item form within and out of a possessive construction (note that there is two types of possession in this language : alienable and unalienable), we have decided to retain the corresponding forms provided for unalienable possession, althought the possessive personal pronoun itself has not been retained. Only the word with a dash (for instance 'cii-', 'his/her skin') has been entered along with the world out of possessive contructions, when showed by the authors
Some worlds have different forms depending on the geographical location. Those locations to which are related those different forms are put in parenthesis ('Y' is for the Yambe location, and 'W' for the Wevia location)"

Kaninuwa has a special counting system. There is an alternative data recorded by Dr. Glen A. Lean about three years ago that suggest they have a counting system based on 12. 12 is expressed by the phrase 'nima fafana nuwa keta nues(manamana tomokaga)', 15 is nima fafana nuwa keta kaetamo', 20 is 'nima fafana nuwa keta kae nuwa, 24 is manamana suesi'. Tallying from 1 to 10 is carried out on the two hands and from 11 to 19 on the feet. The word for 20 is roughly 'hands two feet two'.

Kei, Maluku, Indonesia	keii1239-1	keii1239	keii1239	five	lim			chan2019	Kei.htm		Mr. Felix Ma, SIL International, October 24, 2013.	Kei has a decimal system. 1. The Keiese language has no official orthography of its own, and there are phonetic and lexical differences in this language from one village to another (please glance through the survey write-up attached). The data given above are based on the “dialects” spoken mostly in the southern part of the Lesser Kei Island, which I believe are close to the earliest version of this language. 2. In my opinion, there is no long vowel in Keiese (some Keiese speakers may not agree). [faak] is actually composed of two syllables, i.e. [fa] and [ak]. Some speakers in Lesser Kei might pronounce this word as [fa:ak] just to emphasize the first [a], but that [a] is not a long vowel. [faak] has a variant of [fak], and both are commonly used. The root of [faak] and [fak] is [faka-]; in some villages, the last [a] of [faka-] is dropped and so it is pronounced as [fak], and in others, the [ka] is changed to [ak] (i.e. metathesis) and so it is pronounced as [faak] (both ‘aa’ are stressed, and that is why sometimes it might sound like a long vowel; however, the second ‘a’ might receive slightly more stress in most villages). 3. As I said in my first reply to your email, numerals like ‘ensa’ and ‘enru’ are colloquial versions of ‘ain sa’ and ‘ain ru’ respectively. I believe that most native speakers do not even know that that ‘en’ is the short form of ‘ain.’ I gave you both versions in the table. You may choose to show both in your data if that will not confuse your readers. For formal writing (but well, they don’t even have an official orthography), I would recommend ‘ain’ instead of ‘en.’ [ən] is never stressed (and is often written by native speakers as a proclitic to the following numeral), and so in words like [ənsiᵘ], the stress obviously falls on the diphthong. 4. [aᵘ] and [iᵘ] are diphthongs. In some villages in Greater Kei, the [ᵘ] has been dropped, and so [wa] is for the numeral ‘eight’ and [si] for ‘nine.’ 5. The phoneme /β/ has an allophone of [v] (identical to the English phoneme /v/) which can be heard mostly in Lesser Kei. In my proposed orthography for the language, both /β/ and [v] are represented by the letter ''v''.

Kala Phonemic Inventory: Kala has a phonemic inventory of 23 consonants in four places of articulation (labial, alveolar, palatal, and velar, plus labialization on some labial and velar stops and consonants) and five vowel qualities. Nasalization is phonemically distinguished for vowels, bringing the total of vowel phonemes to 10. The only fricative is /s/ and there is only one liquid, /ɾ/.

The long vowels only occur word finally and are a result of loss of final /n/ with compensatory lengthening. Stress remains on the penultimate vowel for words with a final long vowel. In the standardised IPA transcription the long vowels are transcribed with the half long mark <ˑ> and double vowels are transcribed with the long mark <ː> to keep them separate.

However, Kioko shares its closest linguistic affinities not with Kambowa but with the speech of certain Pancana villages lying immediately to the south oKambowa. For this reason it may be better to regard Kambowa as a distinct language. Kambowa itself comprises three dialects (or subdialects): Kambowa, Pongkowulu, and Mata.

Komering, Sumatra, Indonesia	kome1238-1	kome1238	kome1238	five	lɪmɑ̃			chan2019	Komering.htm		Mr. Karl Anderbeck, SIL International, June 22, 2008.	Komering has a typical Western Austronesian decimal system. The first row is from a lady grown up in a Campang Tollu (Campang Tiga) family. The second ( with an asterisk mark ) is from a man originally from Tanjung Mas, who went to high school in Palembang, so the 'Sɑlɑwi' (25) might be a borrowing from Palembang Malay. The main difference is between the nasal connector for tens (20 to 90), 'm' and 'nɡɑ', respectively. Interestingly the 'm' isn’t used for 50 (limapuluh) and sixty (nompuluh). May be because there is already an 'm': 'lima' and 'nom'? I never heard 'limampuluh', though. And the six (nom) once occupies one syllable and once two. I never got an 'onom'.

Kupang Malay, Timor, Indonesia	kupa1239-1	kupa1239	kupa1239	five	lima			chan2019	Malay-Kupang.htm		Ms. June Jacob, MA. Universitas Kristen Artha Wacana (Artha Wacana Christian University), Kupnag, Indonesia. May 4, 2009.	Kupang Malay has a decimal system. Kupang Malay is a Malay-based creole spoken by as many as 200,000 native speakers in and around the city of Kupang, West Timor. There may be up to an additional 100,000 second language speakers. The lexicon, phonology, and grammar of Kupang have all calqued on local languages in significant ways (see references). As a Malay-based creole in contact with a standard or official variety of Malay (Indonesian), speakers of Kupang Malay function in a post-creole continuum. Some speakers can function fully in the High (Indonesian), and some of them have worked very hard to be able to do so. Therefore it is not surprising that some of these view Kupang Malay as “bad” Indonesian and do not feel it should be given any legitimacy in society, in education, in government, or in the church. Many speakers mix Indonesian and Kupang Malay, and can't always tell you which language or register they are using. Some of these, including many university students in Kupang. Note that the traditional spellingsː j = IPA [d͡ʒ], c = IPA [t͡ʃ].

Kurudu has a quinary counting system different from that of most languages in Yapen Island. Numbers 1 to 5, 10 and 20 are written with one word. Counting system: 1st until 5th finger, 6 - 10 using the fingers of both hands, 11-20 using the toes of both feet. Numbers 11-15, 40, 60, 80 and 100 are written with two words: (11-15) counting starting from 10 toes and 1-5 fingers, added with 1 to 5 fingers from the other hand; (40) 2 times all fingers and toes; (60) 3 times all fingers and toes; (80) four times all fingers and toes. So, the word used for number 20 means: ’intact’, ’everything’, that is all numbers from an intact person. Hence, parsinon ‘one person’ also means ‘20’, and ‘parsinon mandu’ ‘two persons’ means 40. Further, the counting system for counting after number 20 is: ’20 plus 1’, ‘ 20 plus 2’, ‘20+ 3’ etc. The counting system for counting number 30 is: ’20 plus 10’ etc.

In the old days, they would do six and upward by retarding five and one, two, three, etc. At ten they would repeat five twice and then add 'iti', etc, for eleven upwards. Once twenty was reached, twenty became 'one person', or 'iermama kuatia', because a person has ten fingers and ten toes.

Ninde is spoken in the Villages of Labo, Lawa and Windua, Malekula Island. Ninde has a traditional quinary-decimal counting system. However, people only remember the traditional numerals from one to ten now. Numbers one to ten are the only ones found in our data. Ray (1926: 302) gives an outline of constructing numbers up to 1,000. However, it should be noted that Ray's numerals one to ten differ from those elicited in our data. It's difficult to know whether this is due to a difference in transcription, or to a subsequent change in the pronunciation. Ray, Sidney Herbert (1926).

Lakumarau, Papua New Guinea	xxxx0029-1		laku1238	five	lima			chan2019	Lakumarau.htm		Dr. Lidia Federica Mazzitelli, General Linguistics, Department of Linguistics, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany, June 21, 2019.	"Lakumarau or Loxodumau has a quinary numeral system of counting similar to that of the Nalik language. Lakumarau is a newly discovered language, spoken by approximately 800 people in the village Lakurumau, in the New Ireland Province of Papua New Guinea. So far, Lakurumau has only been briefly mentioned in descriptions of the New Ireland languages an defined as a ""transitional dialect"" or a ""transitional language"" between the neighboring Nalik and Kara. Actually, Lakurumau would be better defined as a member of the language chain of Northern New Ireland, comprising of six different languages (Lavongai/Tungak, Tigak, Tiang, Kara, Nalik and Loxodumau). Due to the pressure of Tok Pisin, the vernacular language in Papua New Guinea, the number of fluent speakers is rapidly sinking and the language is at risk of dying out in the next few decades. Traditionally, Lakurumau speakers were also fluent in the neighboring languages Nalik and Kara, which they used in the relationship with their neighbours. The latter would usually not learn Lakurumau, as they deem it to be a ""very difficult"" and ""unintellegible"" language. Nowadays, even if knowledge of Nalik and Kara is still diffused in Lakurumau, communication with Nalik and Kara speakers takes place more and more often in Tok Pisin. Some Lakurumau speakers are also fluent in Papua New Guinea English. Lakurumau is less and less spoken by younger generations; it is endangered and faces a serious threat of extinction in the next decades. Note: The first row is used when counting (1, 2, 3), the second one as modifiers. 1 sakai (a boi) a zaxaa 'one (pig)' 2 iwak (a boi) a ralawa 'two (pigs)' etc. 3 tun a boi a ralorun 4 faat a boi a ralavaat 5 lima a boi a vatmit 6 vizik saxaa a boi a vizik saxaa 7 vizik wak a boi a vizik wak 8 vizik tun a boi a vizik tun 9 vizik faat a boi a vizik faat 10 zangaflu a boi a zangaflu Note that the 'x' is a velar fricative."

People were much less certain regarding the forms, since the classifiers seem to vanish with Tok Pisin influence. Other higher numerals are: 300. matulŋat, 400. mahaŋat, 500. malimŋat,, 600. manonŋat, 700. manodrtilŋet, 800. manondorŋet, 900.manodrsaŋet, 1100. maposih saŋat, 3000. mapotoloh, 4000. mapohahou, 5000. mapolimah, 6000.mapononh, 7000. maponondrtoloh, 8000. maponondoruoh, 9000.maponondrsih, 10,000. maposuŋul, 20,000. maporuŋul, 30,000. mapotilŋul."

Informant: Native speaker from Kalikasa (District Atadei, Regency Lembata, Province NTT, Indonesia). Date and place of collection: Kalikasa (District Atadei, Regency Lembata, Province NTT, Indonesia), 15 May 2015.	The above data is taken from a Lamaholot variety in the Western part of the Atadei district, on the island of Lembata in Nusa Tenggara Timur, Indonesia. Although I am not entirely agreeing with the naming of languages and classification of Lamaholot varieties in glottolog, I can say that if following this structure, my languages probably best fit for Levuka and South Lembata both part of Lamaholot Tengah. So My Western part of Atadei would be Levuka and my Eastern Part of Atadei would be South Lembata. Although it is also possible that South Lembata actually refers to another group of languages.

The numerals 6 -9 are built on the numeral 5. This is done by conjoining the numeral limɛ with the phrase '5 and hold 1, 2, 3, 4'. The word ratele is most likely a shortened form of ra-hit-hɛl-ɛ ' hold-block-REC-TR', meaning 'hold close, grasp (together with)'. Often these numbers are abbreviated by simple saying ratele ɛllɛ. Ten is expressed by analɔx which means 'all the fingers' and twenty is 'ana nɔn kina ɛllɛ' which means 'the bones of one man, or the skeleton of one person'. The numerals 1-10 are still well used by Lote speakers now. For numerals higher than 10, speakers usually revert to English or Pidgin.

Magori number words certainly do not appear to be typically Austronesian and has been strongly influenced by the Magi, a Papuan language. Numeral 5 is the word for 'hand', and the existence of a distinct numerals 10, 'nanau', conceivably borrowed from Magi. The numeral, 3, 'aiseri' may have been borrowed from Magi or one of the Mailuan family languages. Magori is an endangered Austronesian languages.

After 5, they used English numbers with phonological adaptation. Note that the traditional number for five 'dimanina' means 'one hand' but for ten is 'yauou tamoqana' means 'one me' literally, which is interesting because I wouldn’t have thought that would have appeared until 20—using both hands and both feet—but that is what they gave me.

Stober through Mr. Ray Stegeman, SIL International, Papua New Guinea. June 20, 2011.	Malasanga has a system with basic numeral set (1, 2, 3, 4). However, people only keep the traditional numerals from 1 to 5, and 10 now, after ten, they use Tok Pisin. There are two variants given by Pete Lincoln (1976) and Geoff Smith (1984), data from Lincoln (1976) the words for 6 to 9 contain a 'hand' morpheme 'ba-', and the meaning of the suffix '-kes' being uncertain. The word for 20 'korap' means 'man', 'korapta' thus meaning 'man one'.

Na'ahai or Malfaxal is an endangered language spoken on a Toman Island off the southern coast of Malekula in Vanuatu. This language has a traditional quinary counting system. The data were elicited in Batbank and represent the Na’ahai Kiki dialect, as spoken in the area near Melip and Toman Island- not the area near Malvakal (Malfaxal). The speakers had difficulty with some of the higher numbers, saying that they usually just use Bislama now for those. - /nduman/ was sometimes pronounced as [luman]. Numbers starting with /maratin/- I elicted all of these without a preceding /na/; however, when I asked speakers about this morpheme (based on an older list of the numbers), they said that a preceding /na/ is fine, in fact preferred. However, I have left it out of the list above. In any case /i na maratin/, with a preceding /i/, is NOT acceptable according to them. Note that is rough draft only! further research data needed.

Central Mambae, Aileu Vila	mamb1306-Caile	mamb1306	mamb1306	five	liːm			lexirumah	fogaca17			Mambae has a productive process of final CV → VC metathesis. Various different processes of vowel assimilation often occur after metathesis, of which the most regular is complete assimilation of final /a/, e.g. *quzan > *usa > /uus/ ‘rain’. Any double vowel (sequence of two identical vowels) in Mambae — including one created by metathesis — is realised as a single phonetically long, e.g. [uːs] ‘rain’. However, this length is not marked in this wordlist when a double vowel is penultimate, probably due to the length being interpreted as a side effect of stress which is predictably penultimate. Central Mambae also has a suffix /-a/ which is used in the citation form of (some) alienable nouns. This /-a/ suffix triggers metathesis on any stem to which it attaches, with stress shifting one position to the right (thus remaining penultimate). These facts mean that certain nouns which are transcribed with only two vowels of which the final vowel is /a/ are ambiguous between being unmetathesised forms or metathesised forms with the suffix /-a/. Thus, for instance, [osa] ‘money’ could be underlyingly /oos-a/ or /osa/. Such ambiguous cases are treated tentatively as unmetathesised forms in the ‘form’ column with the possible alternate analysis indicated in the comments. Unambiguous instances of the suffix /-a/ are separated by a hyphen in the form column.

""Something has already been mentioned respecting the language of the New-Zealanders, and of its affinity to that of the people of Otaheite; the following Vocabulary will more fully shew this agreement, which is a very extraordinary circumstance, and leads us to conclude that one place was originally peopled from the other, though they are at near two thousand miles distance, and nothing but the ocean intervenes, at least to our knowledge; and such a long navigation, we should hardly believe, could be practicable in their small canoes, the only vessels that they appear to have ever possessed; yet what should lead too distinct people, having no communication with each other, to affix the same sounds to the same things, would be hard to account for In any other manner.""

""This opinion is farther corroborated, by comparing their customs and manners, as also their instruments of war and household utensils, which will be found to agree in many particulars. The migra-tion was probably from New-Zealand to Otaheite; as the inhabitants of the former place were totally unacquainted with the use of bows and arrows till we first taught them; whereas the people of the latter island use them with great dexterity, having doubtless discovered the use of them by some accident after their separation; and it cannot be supposed that the New-Zealanders would have lost so beneficial an acquisition, if they had ever been acquainted with it."""

Mengen, Papua New Guinea	meng1267-1	meng1267	meng1267	five	'limɑ			chan2019	Mengen.htm		Dr. René van den Berg, SIL International, Papua New Guinea, June 5, 2014.	Mengen has a quinary-vigesimal system, with separate words for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 20. All other numbers are combinations. The system appears to be relatively stable up to 39. The word for 40 /ɡiɑu ˈkɑinɑ ˈluɑ/ (20 x 2) is confusing to many people, as it is very similar to 22 /ɡiɑu ˈkɑinɑ bɑ ˈluɑ/ (20 + 2). There are no words for 1000 and 2000. Most people only use Mengen numbers up to 5 or 10, and prefer Tok Pisin for higher numbers. Other notes: 1. The voice on the recording is from Mrs Felicitas Lurume (born in 1970), from the village of Poro near Malmal in the West Pomio district. Mrs Lurume is a teacher at Makain Elementary School and she has given written consent for this recording to be published on the Internet. 2. Mengen has a 7-vowel system /i, e, E, ɑ, ɔ, o, u/, but the contrast between /e/ and /E/ and between /o/ and /ɔ/ appears to be neutralised in closed syllables. 3. Final vowels following consonants are often not pronounced, e.g. / tɑŋuˈlel/ for ‘10’. 4. Word and phrase-medial /b/ and /ɡ/ have fricative allophones [B] and [Ä], in some cases even phrase-initially. The word /bɑ/ ‘and’ is therefore usually pronounced [Bɑ]. 5. The word /kɑinɑ/ in the numeral for ‘20’ and higher has a variant /kEnɑ/.

Meier, PhD Candidate at the department of Linguistics, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, Australia, September 12, 2017.	Mono-Alu is spoken on Mono Island, Alu Island, and Fauro Island in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands, this language has a decimal system. However, now it's highly endangered as all school teaching is conducted in English and the Solomon Islands Pijin/English numeral system is replacing the Mono-Alu vocabulary. Especially the unit terminology for food stuffs is nearly entirely lost today and younger speakers are no longer familiar with it. Note 1: For the number 90 'siahulu, there is some regional variation, though. Speakers on Mono Island will sometimes say uliahulu, while speakers on Alu Island use siahulu only and will correct the use of uliahulu. Note2: The word latu ‘hundred’ also means ‘tribe’. The word kokolei ‘thousand’ is also used to refer to chickens. Traditional counting exists for the following foodstuffs: ripe coconuts are counted in units of fifteen – 15 ripe coconuts: 'ʔɛa 'hɛ:na – 30 ripe coconuts: 'ɛlua 'hɛ:na megapod eggs are counted in units of ten – 10 megapod eggs: 'ʔɛa 'tɔlaʔa – 20 megapod eggs: 'ɛlua 'tɔlaʔa (hunted) possums are counted in sets as well

April 20, 2012.	Mor has a quinary, vigesimal system of counting. The word ''naʔu'' is derived from ''one person''. The numerals go at least up to naʔu tàura = 200. After that, speakers become confused. In principle it should be possible to count up to naʔu tàura maʔa rímó maʔa áʔó maʔa tàura maʔa rímó maʔa áʔó = 399, however no speakers of Mor would be able to understand that. Mor is one of the few tonal Austronesian languages in Papua area, Indonesia.

The quality can often be deduced based on phonotactics and/or cognates in related languages, however, some cases remain ambiguous. Such ambiguous cases are transcribed <e> in the form column and <é> in the orthography column with a comment. Similarly, vowel initial and glottal stop initial words are not differentiated, both are transcribed with an initial vowel. Owen Edwards contacted Louise Baird and she was able to help disambiguate many forms which were otherwise ambiguous.

Nali, Manus, Papua New Guinea	nali1245-2	nali1245	nali1245	five	yimah			chan2019	Nali.htm		Mr. Jerry Pfaff, SIL International, Papua New Guinea, December 16, 2009.	"Nali has a typical ""Manus type"" Austronesian language decimal counting system with special structure for numerals 6 to 9. Please note the following: 3-three: toyoh – The number for three, pronounced “toyoh” has an initial phoneme that presents as a flap ‘r’ intervocalically but as a ‘t’ in word-initial position and as an unreleased ‘t’ in word-final position. Therefore, in the numbers thirteen (‘songui pe royoh’) and twenty-three (‘lungui pe royoh’) it is pronounced and spelled with the ‘r’ but in word-initial position, it is pronounced and spelled by Nali speakers using a ‘t’. 6-six: annoh – Spoken Nali often contracts words by dropping out vowels in multi-syllable words. The number six, when pronounced in a counting sequence is pronounced with a lengthened ‘n’ which is a contraction where there would normally be a vowel ‘o’ between two ‘n’ sounds. If it were talking about six items like six coconuts (‘niu’), then one would say “niu manonoh” and there would be a prefixed ‘m’ plus one would pronounce the vowel ‘o’ between the two ‘n’ sounds. 7-seven: andrtoyoh – Another contraction occurs within the sequence of numbers 7, 8, and 9, where the Nali uses what you probably will recognize from other Austronesian languages – a ‘subtraction’ indicator. Seven is ‘less three’, eight is ‘less two’, and nine is ‘less one’ – as you will recognize those three stems from earlier in the list with the added prefix ‘andro-’ (‘less’). However the ‘o’ in ‘andro-’ sometimes is not pronounced in spoken Nali except before ‘sih’ (in the number 9, it is ‘androsih’). The ‘o’ has been dropped in the contracted numbers 7 (‘andrtoyoh’) and 8 “andrluwoh”. (Note that because the ‘t’ in andrtoyoh is not intervocalic, is presents as a ‘t’ rather than a flap ‘r’ as noted above.) In certain people’s speech, however (whether determined by a speaker’s dialect or idiolect, I am not certain) numbers like 8 ‘andrluwoh’, which is a contraction of “androluwoh” sometimes is contracted instead by dropping the ‘u’ in ‘luwoh’ rather than the ‘o’ in ‘andro-’ and, thus, the number 8 can present as “androlwoh”. 40- forty: hangui or haangui – The number can have a lengthened ‘a’ sound, written here using doubling of the vowel – ‘aa’. The reason for this is not completely clear, but a little information might lead to an educated guess. The Nali number system has a multitude of counting “classes” depending on what is being counted. The system for simply counting the cardinal numbers “one, two, three…” is represented by the same class as that used for counting stones or coconuts. But there are other systems in use for other counting. In most of those systems, the ha- prefix occurs on the number for one of an item. (hakap – one tree leaf; hakol – one place/village; hakou – one tree; hamou – one person/living thing/animal; etc.). To distinguish between ‘one coconut fruit’ and ‘one coconut tree’, the number word carries the appropriate class marker. In this way ‘niu sih’ (one coconut) and ‘niu hakou’ (one coconut tree) can be easily distinguished by the number word which belongs to a certain counting class. Similarly the prefix ‘lu-‘ indicates two of the items listed above (lukap; lukol; lukou; lumou) and the ‘ti- prefix indicates three have the prefix ti- (tikap; tikol; tikou; timou). When you want to count four of an item, however, the prefix is ha- again (as in the basic ‘hahiu’ for the counting number ‘four’, but in order to distinguish it from the singular, the ‘a’ is lengthened in speech. Hence four (when counting leaves) would be pronounced ‘haakap’, and four people ‘haamou’. The lengthening may be a compensation for numbers used when in the act of in counting, versus numbers used in general speaking. For instance, if you had a row or school children and you started to walk along the line counting them, you would count “hamou, lumou, timou, haamou, yimou, …” But if you wanted to report that you just saw one child or two children or three children or four children walking down the street your would report that you saw ‘hamou’ (1), or ‘malmou’ (2 contracted from ‘malumou’) or ‘matimou’(3) or ‘mahamou’ (4). The prefix ma- indicates that you are going to state a number (greater than one). While you would report seeing one child as ‘hamou’, you would report seeing four children as ‘mahamou’. So there is no problem distinguishing between one child and four children, because of the prefix ma- on the numbers after 1. But if you were just looking and counting out loud, you would not use the ‘ma-‘ prefix. You would simply count “hamou, lumou, timou …” as noted above. But when you got to four, you may want to do something to distinguish between hamou (1) and mahamou (4) when you were not using the ma- prefix. This is achieved by lengthening the ‘a’ and saying ‘hamou, lumou, timou, haamou…’ while looking at, for example, a row of children. Thus, sometimes the lengthened ‘a’ in ‘haa-‘ indicates the number 4. This has been written by Nali speakers as ‘aa’, though in normal speech, you would more likely hear ‘mahamou’ rather than ‘mahaamou’, since the ‘ma-‘ helps to indicate the number 4, without having to lengthen the ‘a’ sound. However, in writing there has been a general an inconsistency in writing ‘a’ or ‘aa’ in words that represent the number four (4). Thus, in the number forty (40) one may find it written or pronounced with or without lengthening of the vowel ’a’ – either ‘hangui’ or haangui’. Other numbers noted in parentheses/brackets: Because of contracting words and dropping out some vowels, pronunciation of various words differs from speaker to speaker. Items included in parentheses/brackets represent alternate pronunciations or basic forms without the contractions. The phonetic guide to assist with the pronunciation for the numbers listed above can be found in the preliminary Organized Phonology Data file for the Nali language at: http://www.sil.org/pacific/png/pubs/0000264/Nali.pdf"

Number words ‘one’ to ‘nine’ are analyzed as stative verbs, and are, thus, obligatorily marked by a mood/aspect prefix. It is in this inflected form the number words usually are encountered. The basic numbers up to ‘six’ can be inflected with either perfective (la-/lâ-) or imperfective (tʉ-/tu-) aspect prefixes. The difference between the perfective and imperfective forms is largely that the former ones are used in the expression of a past event, while the latter are used with the expression of a future event. This reflects the general finding about the perfective and imperfective construction types in Engdewu. Note, however, that numbers ‘seven’ to ‘nine’ cannot take perfective marking. This is a peculiarity because they generally appear in relative clauses modifying nouns, and in such clauses verbs are usually prefixed by a perfective marker. The grammatical status of nɔpⁿu ‘ten’ is unclear, since it clearly is not inflected with any of the perfective or imperfective aspect markers.

Nguna or Nakanamanga or North Efate has a quinary, decimal system. the word for 'thousand' manu is a loanword from Polynesian language. The modern Ngana numbers after ten have been replaced by Bislama. The traditional numbers after ten were taken from the old book ' Sketch of Ngana Grammar' by H. Ray in 1887. Note the the 'p with an over nasal symbol<p̃>' expresses the bilabial lens implosive stop.

September 19, 2011.	The old counting system in North Marquesan is based on 20, 40, 4(=e tahi ʔau/e ʔau) and 4000 (=e tahi mano). There is a French loanword 'miri' for thousand. Nowadays the tekau (20) and touhā (40) are used frequently by all speakers; e tahi ʔau (400) and e tahi mano (4000) are only used in specific contexts (e.g. counting coconuts or in narratives (e.g. when talking about an army of warriors). Otherwise the new forms based on the decimal system are preferred. The same holds for 30, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90. For 100, 200, etc. and 1000 the loanwords (hanere, tautini) are used by the majority of speakers regardless of their age. Note: OF=older form, NF=newer form.

Related websiteː http://www.documentingalta.com/alex-garciacutea-laguiacutea.html	Northern Alta has a decimal system spoken by the Negrito people with 200 speakers. 1- No monolingual Alta speakers have been found so far. The speakers I have worked with are all bilingual with Tagalog, and speak Tagalog most of the time. Code switching is very extended in daily life. The data provided here is provisional (specially the stress position, the stress syllable is underlined), and has to be checked with at least a few more speakers of the language in order to be conclusive. 2- The Northern Alta phonological system has not been established yet, therefore no phonemic chart is added. 3- The data was elicited from two different speakers. Both had to take their time when providing numerals beyond ten. When asking the numbers from thirty to ninety, the first speaker provided the number thirty in Tagalog, and forty to ninety were provided in Spanish. 4- The second speaker, whose recording is the one provided here, could give the numbers but in some cases needed the help of her friend. For example, when recording the number two, the language assistant provides the Tagalog form dalawa and then is corrected by another speaker, giving the proper Alta form duwa. The same problem is found in the number twelve where the speaker proposes labin dalawa, instead of the expected labin duwa. The same problem happens with the number six. The speaker gives an alta form innem (e is a schwa), but inconsistently provides ?anim (probably the Tagalog form) for sixteen and sixty. 16 labin ?anim 60 ?anim ?a pulo 5- It is not clear at this point if hundreds, tens and units form one or several phonological and grammatical words. 6- The tens and the units are linked by the linker at: 23: duwa ?apulo at tatlo The connector can be attached to the tens as it can be heard in the recording: 24: duwa ?apulot ?apat More information about these phonological changes will be provided after studying them in depth. 7- Considering the form for number 1: issah, the form issah ?a li:bo should be expected for the number one thousand, the aspiration however disappears, probably due to the following glottal stop.

This lexicon provides recent lexical data, from the Numèè language to French, and, through the transcription alphabet used, phonetic data. However, there is no phonetical or phonological introduction.

Note on the methodology : 
- The borrowed lexical item have been signaled in the source lexicon and have not been retained here
- The word that are morphologically dependant, working as attached words, has been transcribed with a dash before or after the word
- When several words in the source lexicon have been found for a single english word in the list, the one with a meaning closer to the english word have been retained.
- When it has been impossible to find the semantic distinction between several words, they all have been entered, althought the lack of found distinction has been noted in the 'Author annotation' collumn.

Data taken from pp. 323-327 of Nicolas Adriani. 1931, Spraakkunst der Bare'e-taal. Bandoeng: A. C. Nix,	Pamona has a decimal numeral system. Note that spelling conventions: y is used to symbolize a palatal approximant /j/; other symbols have their expected IPA values. Some forms (the ones in gray font) have been inferred from Adriani’s description. Parentheses indicate that pai ‘and’ is optional, e.g. sampuyu (pai) radua means that sampuyu pai radua and sampuyu radua are both valid expressions meaning ‘twelve’. isa ‘one’ is used in straight counting: isa, radua, tatogo, aopo … ‘one, two, three, four …’. In fast counting, the antepenultimate syllable is dropped from 2–7 and 9, and there are further changes to the numbers 3 and 8: isa, dua, dogo, opo, lima, ono, pitu, wayu, sio. sambaʔa is from sa- + waʔa (with nasal ligature); sambaʔa ‘one’ is the most general word for counting objects; in addition to waʔa, sa- can also combine with other, more specific classifiers or measure words, e.g. saogu ‘one (of something that is round or massive)’, saŋkaʤu ‘one (tree, or something that is long)’, just as short forms of the other numerals can (cf. pataogu kayuku ‘four coconuts’ mamongo limaogu ‘five areca nuts’, laumbe togoŋkaʤu ‘three betel pepper fruits’). toumbaʔa can be used as an alternate/replacement term (Dutch wissel term) for tatogo.

There are two sets of higher numbers from 20 to 90 in Pukapuka; the first one is traditional and the second is loanwords from Cook Islands Maori. Hundred is a loanword from English. Numerals higher than a thousand: ŋaulu tini, one hundred thousand maːtinitini 'countless', maːkelekele 'countless as the sand', ŋini maŋone 'unable to be counted', yeː 'infinity', 'uncountable' Pukapukan also has a binary system or counting in pairs (of coconuts) and a system of counting in tens using the prefix tino- 'body' (for people and tuna fish) and there are various other counting classifiers for different objects in a decimal system, at least historically. Some of the forms look like the Penryhn forms e.g. yepulupulu 'ten (pairs of coconuts)'. Counting coconuts: 1. taði tai awaːniu 'one pair of coconuts', lua awaːniu '2 pairs of coconuts', 3. tolu awaːniu '3 pairs of coconuts', waː awaːniu '4 pairs of coconuts', 5. ðeːpulupulu 'ten coconuts' i.e. 5 pairs, ono awaːniu '6 pairs of coconuts', 6. ono awaːniu '6 pairs of coconuts', 7. witu awaːniu '7 pairs of coconuts', 8. valu awaːniu '8 pairs of coconuts', 9. 9. iva awaːniu '9 pairs of coconuts', 22. 22. ðaea ma taði, 24. ðaea ma lua, 26. aea ma tolu, 28. ðaea ma wa: There are also numeral classifiers in Pukapuka: mata- for counting tubers of taro or pulaka e.g. mata-a-ngaulu 10 tubers, mata-lua 20 tubers kau- for counting fruit, round objects, oven stones, pandanus leaves and plaited wall mats.e.g. kau-a-ngaulu 10 [stones], kau-lima 50. ua- counting shellfish, tua- counting crabs, yeke- counting canoe seats, tino- counting tens of humans and bonito fish tino-lua '20 people' Note that the Pukapukan data uses V: for vowel length instead of macrons over the vowels, and velar nasal IPA symbol instead of <ng> but uses <y>, the orthographic symbol, instead of /ð/ or /ðj /,its phonetic value.

May 8, 2012. Data recorded by Dr. Don Laycock, Australian National University, Canberra, February 2, 1978.	Ririo has a traditional counting system with particular formations for 40 to 90, similar to that of the Babatana or Mbambatana language. Ririo is a moribund language-only one person alive has any real degree of fluency, and for local political reasons I was not able to work with her extensively. So the data I provide you with will be mainly from Don Laycock's fieldwork in the 70s. Notes that the differences between orthographic spellings and IPA transcriptionsː 1. é = IPA [ɛ]; 2. c = IPA [ts]; 3. ó = IPA [ɔ]; 4.ñ = IPA [ŋ]; 5. q = IPA [ŋɡ]

A few comments: For 2, nuru is used with inanimates, suru with animates, and is also the default form used when counting. nu- and su- are the dual verbal agreement prefixes for inanimates respectively, while -ru is cognate with the numeral for 2 in other Austronesian languages. For 3 and 4, the -i- in my data would seem to be identical to the 3rd person singular animate verbal agreement marker, though I have no explanation for why it occurs in just these two numerals, and am not ready to say whether these two forms should be considered monomorphemic or bimorphemic. For 3 I also have the alternative form nggokor, which occurs in attributive position. In addition, it is also the verb ""to count"". I do not yet understand the nature of the alternation between these two forms of 3."

Referenceː Chia-jung Pan. A Grammar of Lha'alua, an Austronesian Language of Taiwan. Doctorial thesis submitted to the School of Arts and Social Sciences, James Cook University, Australia. March, 2012.	Lha’alua (known as Saaroa), an Austronesian language of Taiwan. Lha’alua is spoken in Taoyuan Village and Kaochung Village, Taoyuan District, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. There are approximately 400 people of Lha’alua. At the moment, 10-15 people are able to speak the language. The language status of Lha’alua is moribund. Most Formosan languages, Lha’alua (Saaroa) language has three distinctions from 1 to 10 (serial counting, human, and non-human), and two distinctions above 11 (human and non-human). Notes: 1. Serial counting numerals from one to ten are based on the numeral forms (i.e. roots) of nonhuman and human numerals. Numerals from ‘one’ to ‘four’ are formed by vowel lengthening. Numerals from ‘five’ to ‘ten’ are formed by prefixing ku- to the numeral bound root. For the numeral ‘six’, ku- undergoes vowel harmony and becomes ke- in that the following syllables contain the high central unrounded vowel [i], transcribed as e. Nonhuman numerals from one to ten begin with the initial u. For ‘six’, u undergoes vowel harmony and becomes e because the following syllables consist of the high central unrounded vowel [i], transcribed as e. It is difficult to make a decision that the initial u is a nonhuman prefix (i.e. u-) which is added to the numeral root (e.g. ucani ‘one’ as u-cani). The reason can be attributed by the fact that numerals from ten to ninety, numerals from one hundred to nine hundred, numerals from one thousand to nine thousand, and numerals higher than ten thousand all consist of the nonhuman numerals from one to ten as base to derive human numerals. In human numerals, ‘one’, ‘two’, ‘three’, ‘four’, ‘five’, ‘six’, ‘seven’, ‘nine’ and ‘how much/how many’ are formed by (C)a- reduplication. a- reduplication applies when the numeral root is vowel-initial. ‘Eight’ is formed by Ca- triplication. Ca 2. Numerals higher than ten: Knowledge of higher numerals is regarded as a token of expertise in the language. At present, old and fluent speakers tend to use Japanese numerals in everyday life, whereas young and non-fluent speakers employ Mandarin Chinese numerals instead. In Lha’alua, the distinction between serial counting and nonhuman numerals is neutralised in numerals higher than ten. 3. Numerals from ten to nineteen: Lha’alua has two distinctions above 11 (human and non-human)ː numerals from 11 to 19 are formed by addition, namely 10+1, 10+2, etc. Numerals from 11 to 19 can be differentiated in terms of their reference to nonhuman or human participants. When expressing nonhuman numerals from 11 to 19, the nonhuman prefix lailha- ‘TENS-’ is added to the numeral root from 1 to 9.

Gerai and Sekadau are two closely related languages of the the language groups south of the Kapuas River here in West Kalimantan. We have personally worked with two, Gerai and Sekadau. They are very closely related. About 200-250 years ago, the Gerai were part of the Sekadau group. Both these languages are also very similar to the Laur River language. I looked up the ethnologue reference for Semandang. Gerai is listed as a dialect of Semandang. That is definitely not true. Laur, Sekadau and Gerai are all dialects of the same language. However Semandang is very different from those languages. Gerai is located near Semandang, but the languages are not the same.

Sikaiana numbers are often followed by i and the object which is being counted: siaoa i te haahaa 'two taro'. The count­ing system, especially in exponential powers of ten, varies depending upon the item being counted. The classes of items are: (1) birds, coconuts, taro, fruits, dollars; (2) puddings, mats, years; (3) fish; (4) fathoms; and (5) humans. Most younger speakers do not follow these distinctions, instead using the counting system in the first column for all objects, or simply use English terms. birds, coconuts, money, mats, pudding, years, fish length humans 1 tahi tahi tahi seloha hokotahi 2 lua/siaoa lua lua lohalua tokalua 3 tolu tolu tolu lohatolu tokatolu 4 haa haa haa lohahaa tokahaa 5 lima lima lima lohalima tokalima 6 ono ono ono lohaono tokaono 7 hitu hitu hitu lohahitu tokahitu 8 valu valu valu lohavalu tokavalu 9 sivo sivo sivo lohasivo tokasivo 10 sehui kaatoa kaatoa sekumi kaatoa 20 luahui kaulua matalua luakumi tinolua 30 tonnuhui kautolu matatolu tolukumi tinotolu 40 hannahui kauhaa matahaa haakumi tinohaa 50 limanahui kaulima matalima limakumi tinolima 60 onnahui kauono mataono onokumi tinoono 70 hitunohui kauhitu matahitu hitukumi tinohitu 80 vannahui kauvalu matavalu valukumi tinovalu 90 sivanahui kausivo matasivo sivokumi tinosivo 100 kaatoa lau lau lau lau 200 luakaatoa lualau lualau lualau lualau 1000 mano simata simata 10,000 ahe Note that four is probably best represented as haa with a second vowel. My records are onnahui for 60 but it is very likely that they would contract an unstressed vowel so ononahui could be a more formal, slower speech. I am sorry but I have limited contact with the language for 20 years.

This has been confirmed by Peter Steager as definitely not Puluwatese.

Paul Lassettre: The language labeled ""Puluwatese (?)"" that has been determined not to be Puluwatese is Pulo Anna. You can compare it with your own entry for Pulo Anna and see. I've compared it with Odo 1977 as well, and there are some orthographic differences (e.g. ú instead of ɨ) but no really substantial differences. It's also worth noting that ""Pul"" has been used as a code for Pulo Anna in the past; perhaps this was the original code and somebody assumed it signified Puluwates and changed it to ""Puw""."

Na'ahai or called ''South West Bay'' has a quinary counting system. The data were elicited in Batbank and represent the Na’ahai Kiki dialect, as spoken in the area near Melip and Toman Island- not the area near Malvakal. The speakers had difficulty with some of the higher numbers, saying that they usually just use Bislama now for those. Note that /nduman/ was sometimes pronounced as [luman]. Numbers starting with /maratin/- I elicted all of these without a preceding /na/; however, when I asked speakers about this morpheme (based on an older list of the numbers), they said that a preceding /na/ is fine, in fact preferred. However, I have left it out of the list above. In any case /i na maratin/, with a preceding /i/, is NOT acceptable according to them.

January 3, 2009.	Southeast Ambrym has five Austronesian numbers. When I sent you the material that you requested before, I had sought the advice of one of the Southeast Ambrym men that I was working with. However, since that time, I have done more research and below is the conventions that we are currently using. Most people do not know numbering beyond five and so much of the numerical system is hypothetical based on what people speculate that it should be. I have tried to add in an explanation of what is being said for the cases that differ. As I noted in the attached paper, numerical data beyond the number five is subject to change because people rarely count above 5 using their language and after 8 years of working and living with the people I've discovered that they do not think numerically. If you were to ask someone how many children they have, they would have to name each one and count on their fingers as they think of their children by name, not number. Even in the same conversation, 2 minutes later, if asked to verify that they had 5 children, they would need to start counting all over again. This is the same for number of gardens, pigs, cattle, chickens. People that come to do population or agricultural census find it maddening because if they ask people 5 times to say how many chickens they have, they will often get 5 different answers. This past year the local translators and I tried to confirm the numbering system in the two languages for our own use. So what I've attached is what we are currently using after some research and testing. 21 is expressed by ' one man and one more' and 30 is 'one man and two hands two'. Southeast Ambrym has five Austronesian numbers. When I sent you the material that you requested before, I had sought the advice of one of the Southeast Ambrym men that I was working with. However, since that time, I have done more research and below is the conventions that we are currently using. Most people do not know numbering beyond five and so much of the numerical system is hypothetical based on what people speculate that it should be. I have tried to add in an explanation of what is being said for the cases that differ.
Southeast Ambrym, Vanuatu	sout2859-1	sout2859	sout2859	five	lim			chan2019	Ambrym-Southeast.htm		Mr. Leigh Labrecque, SIL International, Vanuatu, December 4, 2004. January 3, 2009.	Southeast Ambrym has five Austronesian numbers. When I sent you the material that you requested before, I had sought the advice of one of the Southeast Ambrym men that I was working with. However, since that time, I have done more research and below is the conventions that we are currently using. Most people do not know numbering beyond five and so much of the numerical system is hypothetical based on what people speculate that it should be. I have tried to add in an explanation of what is being said for the cases that differ. As I noted in the attached paper, numerical data beyond the number five is subject to change because people rarely count above 5 using their language and after 8 years of working and living with the people I've discovered that they do not think numerically. If you were to ask someone how many children they have, they would have to name each one and count on their fingers as they think of their children by name, not number. Even in the same conversation, 2 minutes later, if asked to verify that they had 5 children, they would need to start counting all over again. This is the same for number of gardens, pigs, cattle, chickens. People that come to do population or agricultural census find it maddening because if they ask people 5 times to say how many chickens they have, they will often get 5 different answers. This past year the local translators and I tried to confirm the numbering system in the two languages for our own use. So what I've attached is what we are currently using after some research and testing. 21 is expressed by ' one man and one more' and 30 is 'one man and two hands two'.

South Marquesan, Fr. Polynesia	sout2866-1	sout2866	sout2866	five	e ʔima			chan2019	Marquesan-South.htm		Dr. Gabriele Cablitz, Seminar für Allgemeine & Vergleichende Sprachwissenschaft, Universität Kiel (University of Kiel), Kiel, Germany. September 19, 2011.	The old counting system in South Marquesan is in some respect different to the North Marquesan one. It also uses 20 and 40, but uses 200 (=e tahi ʔau) and 2000 (=e tahi mano) as counting units. In South Marquesan, there is also more use of tekau ‘20’ in composed numerals (cf. 60, 70, 80, 90). Nowadays the tekau (20) and toufā (40) are used frequently by all speakers (same as in North Marquesan); there are a third newer forms for 60 'e ono ʔonohuʔu'. and 90 'e ʔua toufaː me te ʔonohuʔu'. However, e tahi ʔau and e tahi mano have now the same meaning as in North Marquesan, i.e. e tahi ʔau is ‘400’ and e tahi mano is ‘4000’. ʔau and mano do not occur on their own, but are constructed with the numeral construction e tahi ‘one’ and therefore seem to be more like other collective nominals in the language. Again e tahi ʔau and e tahi mano are only used in specific contexts (the same as in North Marquesan). Otherwise the new forms which are based on the decimal system are preferred and normally used. The same holds for 30, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90. For 100, 200, etc. and 1000 the loanwords (hanere and tautini from English / miri from French 'mille') are used by the majority of speakers regardless of their age. The usage of the decimal system is already attested in the dictionary of Dordillon (latter half of the 19th century). Note: OF=older form, NF=newer form.

North Marquesan has a special counting system based on 20, 40 and 400. The origins for 40 'touha' and 400 ʔau' are unclear but the people still use them to count coconuts and persons now. There are loanwords from English 'haːnere' 100 and 'tautuni' 1000'.

Although I am not entirely agreeing with the naming of languages and classification of Lamaholot varieties in glottolog, I can say that if following this structure, my languages probably best fit for Levuka and South Lembata both part of Lamaholot Tengah. So My Western part of Atadei would be Levuka and my Eastern Part of Atadei would be South Lembata. Although it is also possible that South Lembata actually refers to another group of languages.

""REMARKS on the Otaheitean Language.
The language is very soft, having a great number of vowels, diphthongs, and triphthongs. Every word, almost, begins with a vowel, which they most commonly drop.

It is also very metaphorical, as I have observed in many instances; as Matapoa, a person blind of an eye, which literally is Night-eye. Mataavai, the name of the bay we anchored in, literally signifies Watery-eye; which appellation is not unapt from the great quantity of rain which falls in the bay. Tehaia, a woman's name, who being lost when a child, her friends went about, crying Tehai? which means, Where is she? The natives could not repeat, after us, the sounds of the letters, Q, X, and Z, without great difficulty; G, K, and S, they could not pronounce at all.  Many of the names of the people of our ship having the G, K, or S, in them, they could not approach nearer the sound of them than as follows:

Toote, for Cook.
Matà for Monkhouse.
Opane - Banks
Petrodero — Pickersgill
Tolano — Solander
Tate — Clark
Treene — Green
Poline — Spoving
Hite — Hicks
Taibe — Stainsby
Towara — Gore
Patine — Parkinson

""They have various sounds peculiar to themselves, which none of us could Imitate; some of them they pronounced like B and L mingled together; others between B and P, and T and D. Some like Bh, Lh, and Dh. When they mean to speak of a thing somewhat small, they often double the word, as Oorè oorè, a smallish nail. They also double the word for the superlative, as teá teá, very white. Mai, when placed after a verb, signifies that the action was done to you. 
Mai, when added to an adverb, signifies several things, as Mai Maroo, somewhat soft, or inclining to be soft. They have a whoop, when they call after any person, which they pronounce like Ahu! raising their voice very high at the last syllable."""

"Tami has a quinary counting system based on hand 'lima' and man ''taumoandeʔ''. Note that all sounds represented are consistent with IPA standards with the exception of [ô] which is similar to [u] but higher up and further back. And just a brief bit of explanation on the 'numbers' larger than 100. After 100 they typically do not specify (or even try to) a specific quantity. The phrase ''akanoŋ tau tau isan'' means ""plenty"" or ''lots''. Adding the modifiers ""tau tau"" conveys then a sense of ''really a lots'' and then ''isan'' would function as a superlative conveying a sense of ""too many to count""."

Tausug, Philippines	taus1251-1	taus1251	taus1251	five	li'ma			chan2019	Tausug.htm		Mr. & Mrs. Seymour & Lois Ashley, SIL International, February 28, 2006, March 11, 2013.	Tausug still has the traditional Austronesian numbers after ten. Please note that in Tausug there is always a glottal stop between contiguous vowels: aa = aʔa ai = aʔi, au = aʔu etc. with each possible vowel combination. Therefore in the orthography, the glottal stop is not written between vowels. When two vowels come together (making two syllables) but there is no glottal stop, the semi-vowel is used between vowels. For example: dua = duwa, siam = siyam (Note dua is not pronounced as one syllable (dwa), but as two syllables (duwa). There is contrastive length on each of the three vowels. The lengthened vowel is written with a macron over the vowel. ipun (tooth) / īpun (slave) , ūd (worm), ād (fence). The word “ʔisa” is used only in counting. ʔisa, duwa, tū, etc.”one, two, three, etc.” In counting you do not say, hambuuk, duwa, tū, etc. The word “hambuuk” is a single thing or unit.

Tina Sambal, Philippines	tina1248-1	tina1248	tina1248	five	li'ma			chan2019	Sambal-Tina.htm		Ms. Hella G. Goschnik. SIL International, Philippines. June 24, 1993. November 11, 2009. February 5, 2014.	Tina Sambal has a decimal system similar to that of Abenlen Ayta. Tina Sambal actually does not have stress but short and long pre-final syllables. But when Western linguists analyze it, they hear it as “stress”. That is, words which have a short vowel in the pre-final syllable are analyzed as having stress in the final syllable because that’s what it sounds like to Western ears, e.g. lo’wa is actually [lowa:] (the colon stands for length). And the words with long vowels in the pre-final syllable are said to have stress in the pre-final syllable, ex. ma’polo ‘ten’ which is actually [mapo:lo:]. The mark for stress which is used in the list above is the apostrophe { ‘ } and is written before the so–called stressed syllable. Probably this request came because some of the Tina Sambal numbers do not have a stress mark in the list below. The two-syllable words which do not have a stress mark are words which have two consonants next to each other in the middle of the word and therefore are neutral for stress in Tina Sambal. The word can be said either way, stressing the first or the second syllable because the first syllable is closed and so both syllables are short. So there is no fixed “stress” on either syllable. Examples are aʔsa {a-sa} ‘one’ (note: the question mark is used by the writer for the glottal stop which is also a consonant and in Tina Sambal written as a hyphen { - }). This could be pronounced as ‘aʔ-sa or as aʔ’sa. The same is true for the following words: aʔpat {a-pat} ‘four’ could be pronounced as ‘aʔpat or aʔ’pat aʔnom {a-nom} ‘six’ could be pronounced as ‘aʔnom or aʔ’nom and all the words which contain these numbers.

The dictionary have been published in the Pacific Linguistics journal (Series C - n°12) of 1976.

This work contains a short phonetical and phonological introduction and a Tîrî-English lexicon.


Methodology used here :
If for an english word in the list, there are several lexical item including one single lexical unit, a compound (i.e made of several lexical units), or even a word resulting of a derivation, the word being a single lexical unit has been retained before anything else
If more than one word in Tîrî has been found for a single english word, some specifications about the use of the different words not being morphological variables have been, when possible, provided in the 'Author annotation' column
The word with the most general meaning have been retained.
If a word that is morphologically dependant and generally attached to an other word, it has been transcribed with a dash before or after word.
If the semantic distinction between several words is not clear, those words have been provided with a comment in the 'Author annotation' column regarding to this lack of semantic distinction."

August 30, 1998, December 6, 2012.	"Titan has a typical ""Manus type"" Austronesian language decimal counting system with special structure for numerals 6 to 9. The formation of number 50 is different from those of other tens. The Titan data were recorded, from fieldwork in Manus that I did in 1975. Here is the basic numeral set for serial counting (in counting houses, pigs, trees, coconuts, bunches of betel nuts, etc. a numeral classifier must be used, and the sets are slightly different, e.g. um a-se-m 'one house', pow a e-a-mo 'one pig', key a se-y 'one tree', niw a si 'one coconut', brue e a-mbung 'one bunch of betel nuts', where um = house, pow = pig, key = tree, niw = coconut, and brue = betel nut): I've marked morpheme boundaries. All final vowels are automatically followed by glottal stop and all sequences of high vowel + unlike vowel are followed by a glide homorganic with the high vowel."

Taking information from a FB group called 'Belajar Bahasa Tondano' and some earlier Tondano work by James Sneddon (1975) gives numbers in the teens and 10's being formed slightly differently as in: 11. 'mapulu wo esa' ('wo' = and/with), 19. mapulu wo siow', 21. 'rua -nga pulu wo esa', 32. 'telu -nga pulu wo rua' ....and so on. Numbers in the 100's and 1000's are then formed with '-nga atus' and '-nga riwu' as in: 300. 'telu -nga atus', 6000. 'enem -nga riwu'. So, something like 8,567 would be 'ualu -nga riwu (wo) lima -nga atus (wo) enem -nga pulu (wo) pitu' Note that in the traditional orthographic spellingsː vowel 'schwa' <e > is equal to IPA [ɘ] and <é > = IPA [ɛ].

Ujir, Maluku, Indonesia	ujir1237-1	ujir1237	ujir1237	five	lima			chan2019	Ujir.htm		Dr. Antoinette Schapper, LACITO-CNRS, Paris, France, June 27, 2019. Reference: Anoinette Schapper & Marian Klamer, 2014: Numeral Systems in Alor-Pantar Languages, Leiden University.	Ujir has a decimal numeral system with substructures for numbers 7 and 8. Like other Aru languages, the Ujir numerals for ‘seven’ and ‘eight’ are complex numerals. Dubusam is an additive numeral (6+1) composed of dubu ‘six’ and -sam, apparently historically derived from, ‘one’. Karua is an multiplicative numeral (4x2) composed of ka ‘four’ and rua ‘two’. The numeral ‘ten’ is also complex, being composed of ui ‘tens’ and sia ‘one’. Higher decades are formed by replacing sia with another numeral, thus: ui rua ‘twenty’, ui lati ‘thirty’, ui ka ‘forty’ etc. The numerals ‘one’. This means there are apparently two forms of the numeral ‘one’ (set or sia) in Ujir. The choice between these forms is dependent on the arithmetical context. Set is used in additive contexts, that is, where one referent (1) or an additional one referent is added to a higher numeral (2). (1) letay set canoe one ‘one canoe’ (2) letay ui rua ma set canoe tens two plus one ‘twenty-one canoes’ Sia is used in multiplicative contexts to create higher numerals that multiplicands of ‘one’, such as (3), (4) and (5). (3) letay ui sia canoe ten one ‘ten canoes’ (4) letay rat sia canoe hundred one ‘one hundred canoes’ (5) letay ribu sia canoe thousand one ‘one thousand canoes’ 2 Sia has a further use outside of numeral contexts. In (6) and (7), sia is not combined with another numeral, but is used by itself with a noun to denote specific indefinite reference (‘a certain’, ‘a particular’ etc.). (6) Fit sia, anin dibil,… night one wind stiff ‘On a certain night, there was a stiff breeze, … (7) Waktu sia, a-ratan fana sia,… time one 3.ACT-reach village one ‘One time, (the boat) reached a certain village,… Formation of higher numerals. As already observed above, multiples of bases such as ui ‘ten’ and rat ‘hundred’ are created by placing another numeral after base numeral, as in (8) and (9). (8) ui rua ‘twenty’, ui lati ‘thirty’, ui ka ‘forty’… (9) rat rua ‘two hundred’, rat lati ‘three hundred’, rat ka ‘four hundred’… Adding digits (‘one’ to ‘nine’) to (multiples of ) bases is achieved by means of the “augmenter” ma between the base (and its multiplier, if any) and the added digit, such as in (10) and (11). (10) ui sia ma set ‘eleven’, ui lati ma tera ‘thirty-nine’, ui dubusam ma dubusam ‘seventy-seven’… (11) rat rua ma rua ‘two hundred and two’, rat dubu ui du.

Wandamen or Wondama has a quinary-vigesimal system. The word siniotu siri is derived from ''one person'' Numbers 1 to 5 as well as number 10 are written with one word; 6-9 with three words, meaning ‘5 and 1’, ‘5 and 2’ etc. Counting system: 1st until 5th finger, 6 - 10 using the fingers of both hands, 11-20 using the toes of both feet. Numbers 11-15 are written with three words, meaning: ’10 and 1’, ’10 and 2’ etc. Numbers 16-19 are written with five words, meaning: ’10 and 5 and 1’, ’10 and 5 and 2’ etc. For number 20 the word ‘person’ is used; this of course because an intact person represents number 20 (10 fingers and 10 toes); hence that’s also how number 20 is counted. So, 21= ‘person and 1’etc. 40=’two persons’. 60=’three persons’. 80=’4 persons’. 30=’one person and 10’. 50=’2 persons and 10’ etc.

The Kai dialect of Waropen has a vigesimal system. Numbers 1 to 10 are written with one word. Counting system: Numbers 11-19 are written with three words, meaning ’10 + 1’, ’10 + 2’ etc. Counting system for number 20 is by using all fingers and toes. So, the word used for number 20 means: ’intact’, ’everything’, that is all numbers from an intact person. Hence, nunggu natio ‘one person’ also means ‘20’, or with using ‘asatio’ which is a short form of ‘sasa etio’ (one person). Further, the table of 20 is used, for instance ‘asanduo ‘ (two persons) means 40; asanggoro (3 persons) for 60, asanggako (4 persons) for 80, asandimo (5) persons for 100, etc. Further, the counting system for counting after number 20 is: ’20 plus 1’, ‘ 20 plus 2’, ‘20plus 3’ etc. The counting system for counting number 21 is: ‘asati oka wosio’ meaning ’20 plus 1’.

Waropen has a traditional quinary, vigesimal numeral system, but now it has adopted the decimal system. Notesː 1. 1. The first 4 numerals (1 to 4) are root numerals and appear only in compounds, there are several sets, of which the prefix wo- is the inanimate unmarked variety, as apposed to naŋ- which is used to count animate nouns. Furthermore we find roŋ- to count fathems, fe- to count slices of folded sago and eŋ- to express a total. 2. 2. Numeral roots cannot be found in isolation but are at least followed by the noun phrase marker –o. 3. *We have encountered an archaic Austronesian set of numerals from five to nine in the village of Napan and in oral literature. The /χ/ represents voiced pharyngeal fricative. It is possible that χ is a prefix. 4. ** nuŋgu represents one full person. As a person is animate it is followed by the numeral set with prefix naŋ-. 5. *** no units for 300 or more were found, except one instance: wana, for 400, but this could not be verified against other informants. 6. 3. Reduplication is possible on numerals from 1 to 5 and 10. 7. 4. Number is expressed on verbal paradigm, where I distinguish single, dual, trial and plural. Dual is always used to indicate two persons, trial always indicates three persons, and plural is used for four persons or more. This system is adopted in the local variety of Malay. 8. 5. Stress is expressed by relative high pitch on the penultimate syllable of the compound noun.

West Uvea or Fagauvea has the only Polynesian language use a quinary numeral system. It is probably the original decimal Polynesian people influenced by the nearby Iaai people who used a quinary numeral system, and changed from a decimal system to a quinary one. There are two sets of numerals from 11 to 20, the second way was the archaic form. The word 'tupu' means 'sum', 'teanua' in 'tahi a teanua' means 'human body', 'nea' in 'tahi enea' means 'man'. Nowadays, the West Uvea or Faga Uvea people use French or Iaai numeral systems more frequently.

December 31, 2012.	Numerals in Penan Benalui or Western Penan are based on a very regular decimal system of justaxposition. These constructions differ partly from those in Kenyah languages. While the numerals themselves are mostly shared with Kenyah (as also most languages of other nomadic groups), the construction based on the numeral jap /d͡ʒap/ 'ten', which actually means ‘to count’, is unique. Other Kenyah languages and many other nomadic languages use for ‘ten’ the Austronesian word pulu. The addition construction with jap in Penan Benalui for the numerals from ten to twenty is syntactically different as it is formed by placing the number from one to nine after jap; for example, ‘eleven’ is jejap jah /d͡ʒəd͡ʒap/. In Kenyah languages the unit is followed by the word sueɂ ‘more, plus’ preceding the numeral ‘ten’, as in Badeng caɂ sueɂ pulo which is literally ‘one plus ten’.

Phonological surface forms are given here (underlyingly, labialized consonants Cʷ are sequences of C and o; thus e.g. koik ‘four’). 3. Elements in parentheses are optional 4. Most forms can occur with and without the classifier prefix ka-, depending on the head noun; only forms without classifier are given here.

Wooi has a vigesimal system. The word ''pya'' is derived from ''one person''. I haven’t done further analysis on phonemic system and phonology of the language so the tress pattern and consonant and vowel inventories I give are still tentative and they are needed to be investigated in detail. For instance, the sound [ø] and [N] are found but they are appeared to be restricted and need further investigation whether they are allophones or phonemes. The basic syllabic stress is in the penultimate position (here I bold the syllable being stressed).

Wotu, Sulawesi, Indonesia	wotu1240-1	wotu1240	wotu1240	five	alima			chan2019	Wotu.htm		Dr. David Mead, SIL International, February 23, 2012. Data has been taken from pages 52-54 of: Salombe C; B. Menggang Lausa, Rahim Hamid, and Carolus Uli. 1987. Struktur bahasa Wotu, Jakarta: Pusat Pembinaan dan Pengembangan Bahasa, Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan.	Wotu has a decimal system. Other numeral expressions provided by Salombe et al. (1987:52) include: 31 = talu pulu saŋo 41 = pata pulu saŋo 61 = anama pulu saŋo 69 = anama pulu sassio 71 = pitu pulu saŋo 81 = walu pulu saŋo 91 = sia pulu saŋo 101 = satu saŋo 109 = satu sassio 110 = satu sapulu 201 = duatu saŋo 300 = talu atu 301 = talu atu saŋo 400 = patatu 500 = limatu 501 = limatu saŋo 600 = anamatu 601 = anamatu saŋo 700 = pitu atu 701 = pitu atu saŋo 800 = walu atu 801 = walu atu saŋo 900 = sewatu 3000 = talunsou 10,000 = sapulusou 100,000 = satunsou ============================== Summary in prose, with examples, by David Mead The basic Wotu numerals one through nine are as follows. The numbers one through six and nine have distinct independent and bound forms. independent bound sango sa ‘one’ duango dua ‘two’ taluango talu ‘three’ patango pata ‘four’ alima lima ‘five’ ana anama ‘six’ pitu pitu ‘seven’ walu walu ‘eight’ sassio sia ‘nine’ Bound forms are used preceding powers of ten, namely pulu ‘ten’, atu ‘hundred’ and sou ‘thousand’. Combinations which have been attested in the corpus are as follows (data mostly from Salombe, et al. 1987:52-53). Note the vowel coalescence which occurs when a bound numeral ending in a is followed by atu ‘hundred’. The expression for ‘fifty’ (taken from Sande, et al. 1991:78) is irregular, as the independent rather than the bound form of ‘five’ is used. The expression ‘nine hundred’ is irregular, where sewatu occurs (instead of expected siatu). sapulu ‘10’ satu ‘100’ sansou ‘1000’ dua pulu ‘20’ duatu ‘200’ duansou ‘2000’ talu pulu ‘30’ talu atu ‘300’ talunsou ‘3000’ pata pulu ‘40’ patatu ‘400’ alima pulu ‘50’ limatu ‘500’ anama pulu ‘60’ anamatu ‘600’ pitu pulu ‘70’ pitu atu ‘700’ walu pulu ‘80’ walu atu ‘800’ sia pulu ‘90’ sewatu ‘900’ Compare also for ten thousand and above: sapulusou ‘10,000’ (Salombe et al. 1987:53) alima pulu nsou ‘50,000’ (Sande, et al. 1991:122) satunsou ‘100.000’ (Salombe et al. 1987:53) duatunsou ‘200,000’ (Sande, et al. 1991:122) Complex numeric expressions are formed by variously combining forms such as above in order of decreasing value. The following are exemplary: s-atu sa-pulu duango one-hundred one-ten two ‘one hundred twelve’ (Sande, et al. 1991:81) s-atu sa-pulu pitu one-hundred one-ten seven ‘one hundred seventeen’ (Sande, et al. 1991:81) lima atu sa-pulu sango five hundred one-ten one ‘five hundred eleven’ (Sande, et al. 1991:81) dua-n-sou s-atu sango two-lg-thousand one-hundred one ‘two thousand one hundred one’ (Sande, et al. 1991:81) When quantity is indicated without the use of a classifier or measure word, an independent form of the numeral is used. sango burau ‘one egg’ (Sande, et al. 1991:80) duango burau ‘two eggs’ (Sande, et al. 1991:80) taluango lemba ‘three boats’ (Sande, et al. 1991:80) patango burau ‘four eggs’ (Sande, et al. 1991:80) lipa ana ‘six sarongs’ (Sande, et al. 1991:101) bete sassio ‘nine fish’ (Sande, et al. 1991:101) When a classifier or measure word is present, the numeral immediately precedes the classifier or measure word. Both independent and bound forms have been attested in this position for the numerals one through five, but only independent forms for six through nine. sango urra potolo one root pencil ‘one pencil’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63) sa-m-baa ana manu one-lg-head child chicken ‘one chick’ (Sande, et al. 1991:79) duango bobba surra two flat.object letter ‘two letters’ (Sande, et al. 1991:81) dua boba dopi two flat.object board ‘two boards’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63) banua-na taluango bobba house-3 three flat.object ‘his three houses’ (Sande, et al. 1991:82) talu m-baa manu three lg-head chicken ‘three chickens’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63) patango ganto juku four cut meat ‘four chunks of meat’ (Sande, et al. 1991:79) pata m-baa bete four lg-head fish ‘four fish’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63) alima ito-na bawine five person-3 female ‘five women’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63) alima bae punti five fruit banana ‘five bananas’ (Sande, et al. 1991:81) banua-na lima bobba house-3 five flat.object ‘his five houses’ (Sande, et al. 1991:79) [1] ana litere bae six liter pestled.rice ‘six liters of pestled rice’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63) pitu bobba lipa seven flat.object sarong ‘seven sarongs’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63) walu tingke bunga eight stem flower ‘eight flowers’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63) sassio baa-na manu nine head-3 chicken ‘nine chickens’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63)

They use a slightly different counting system to count people. The numbers over 20 the system is identical to the system for cardinal numbers for counting objects. For counting from 1 persons to 19 people the numbers are used as followsː 1.hemea, 2.helaɡui, 3.oʔodui, 4.ɡunaroa, 5.aipani, 6.oloroa, 7.oloromemea, 8.fainaroa, 9.faimea, 10.hefua, 11. hefue ma hemea, 12.hefua ma helaɡui, 13. hefua ma 'oʔodui, ... 19.hefua ma faimea. Wuvulu counting also has binary, quaternary, and hexadecimal systems used for counting piles of coconuts. The base-16 system counts into the thousands. these systems were use in the past when a coconut plantation was in operation, but do not appear to be used much today. 1.Base twoː roa 'two', gua 'four', odu 'eight', reya 'ten' 2.Base fourː obau 'four', ruaʔo 'eight', oduʔo 'twelve', hemoro 'sixteen', 3.Base sixteenː hemoro 'one sixteen', guamoro 'two sixteens', odumoroi 'three sixteens' gunaroamoro 'four sixteens', aipanimoro 'five sixteens', oloroamamoro 'seven sixteens', fainaroamoro 'eight sixteens', faimamanoro 'nine sixteens', hepi i 'ten sixteens'.

The source lexicon used here provides an under construction lexicon, as well as a sketch of the Xârâgurè grammar and phonology system.
I personnaly thank Claire Moyse-Faurie for making available to me those precious data.

Methodology : 
If for an english word in the list, there are several lexical item including one single lexical unit, a compound (i.e made of several lexical units), or even a word resulting of a derivation, the word being a single lexical unit has been retained before anything else
If more than one word in Xârâgurè has been found for a single english word, some specifications about the use of the different words not being morphological variables have been, when possible, provided in the 'Author annotation' column
The word with the most general meaning have been retained.
If a word that is morphologically dependant and generally attached to an other word, it has been transcribed with a dash before or after word.
If the semantic distinction between several words is not clear, those words have been provided with a comment in the 'Author annotation' column regarding to this lack of semantic distinction."

The data presented here are coming from the 2014 version of a yet to be published dictionnary Xârâguè-French. Those data have been collected by Claire Moyse-Faurie during two fieldworks in 1977 and 1980. This linguist provided a description of the Xârâcùù language, spoken near the Xârâgurè area.
The source lexicon used here provides an under construction lexicon, as well as a sketch of the Xârâgurè grammar and phonology system.
I personnaly thank Claire Moyse-Faurie for making available to me those precious data.

Methodology :
If for an english word in the list, there are several lexical item including one single lexical unit, a compound (i.e made of several lexical units), or even a word resulting of a derivation, the word being a single lexical unit has been retained before anything else
If more than one word in Xârâgurè has been found for a single english word, some specifications about the use of the different words not being morphological variables have been, when possible, provided in the 'Author annotation' column
The word with the most general meaning have been retained.
If a word that is morphologically dependant and generally attached to an other word, it has been transcribed with a dash before or after word.
If the semantic distinction between several words is not clear, those words have been provided with a comment in the 'Author annotation' column regarding to this lack of semantic distinction."

This book, intended to speakers usage, provides two lexicons, one in xârâcùù-french, and one in french-xârâcùù. 

Methodology used here to enter the lexical data : 
- The synonymy has been reduced by going through both lexicons.
- When two words in Xârâcùù are presented with a slash (for instance ""xãⁿdɨ/xãⁿdɤ"", it means that those words are two morphological forms of the same word (generally related to geographical distribution of this word).
- When both simple words and compound words are possible in Xârâcùù to translate a word in the list, we have opted for the simple words.
- When a word is not phonologically autonomous (i.e being a prefix or a suffix), a dash has been put after the word (prefix) or before the word (suffix).

This book provides a phonological and lexical sketch of the Sichëë language, spoken by the tribes on the see side between the Moindou and Bourail villages located on the Main Land ('Grande Terre') of New Caledonia.
The lexicon this book presents is not a dictionnary. It presents Sichëë words translated and define in French, althought the lexicon is not as fine-grained as other scientific lexicons mainly because of the language vitality (this languages, if not extinct already, is severely in danger).
Methodology used here to enter the lexical data :
- The synonymy has been reduced by going through both lexicons.
- When both simple words and compound words are possible in Sichëë to translate a word in the list, we have opted for the simple words (i.e made by only one lexical unit).
- When a word in the list can not be translated by a single general item in Sichëë, some semantic specifications for each one of them have been provided in the 'author annotation' column."
